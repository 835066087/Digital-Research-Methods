In this assignment, you are going to use a number of the techniques that you \
learned in this class to explore a collection of digital sources. Although \
your sources can relate to whatever subject you\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like, they \
should be thematically chosen. That is to say that they should be about a \
particular subject or topic, or related in some substantial way. Your sources \
have to be digital and the majority of them (but not all) have to be textual. \
You also have to assemble a large enough collection of sources that it makes \
sense to analyze them using computational techniques because you wouldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have time to read and study them using traditional \
methods.\
