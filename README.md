Digital-Research-Methods
========================

Files for Digital Research Methods with Mathematica. More information at http://williamjturkel.net/digital-research-methods-with-mathematica/

I've been refining this material as I teach it to undergraduate and graduate students (and as Mathematica is updated).

* V1 slides 2015, tested with Mathematica v10.2
* V2 slides 2016
* V3 slides 2018, tested with Mathematica v11.3
