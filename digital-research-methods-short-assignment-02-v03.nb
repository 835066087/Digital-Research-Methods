Appendices I - XII\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreface\\n\\n\\nThis book is a slice of \
intensified history--history as I saw it. It\\ndoes not pretend to be \
anything but a detailed account of the November\\nRevolution, when the \
Bolsheviki, at the head of the workers and\\nsoldiers, seized the state power \
of Russia and placed it in the hands\\nof the Soviets.\\n\\nNaturally most of \
it deals with \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Red Petrograd,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
the capital and heart\\nof the insurrection. But the reader must realize that \
what took place\\nin Petrograd was almost exactly duplicated, with greater or \
lesser\\nintensity, at different intervals of time, all over Russia.\\n\\nIn \
this book, the first of several which I am writing, I must confine\\nmyself \
to a chronicle of those events which I myself observed and\\nexperienced, and \
those supported by reliable evidence; preceded by two\\nchapters briefly \
outlining the background and causes of the November\\nRevolution. I am aware \
that these two chapters make difficult reading,\\nbut they are essential to \
an understanding of what follows.\\n\\nMany questions will suggest themselves \
to the mind of the reader. What\\nis Bolshevism? What kind of a governmental \
structure did the Bolsheviki\\nset up? If the Bolsheviki championed the \
Constituent Assembly before\\nthe November Revolution, why did they disperse \
it by force of arms\\nafterward? And if the bourgeoisie opposed the \
Constituent Assembly\\nuntil the danger of Bolshevism became apparent, why \
did they champion\\nit afterward?\\n\\nThese and many other questions cannot \
be answered here. In another\\nvolume, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov to \
Brest-Litovsk,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I trace the course of the\\nRevolution \
up to and including the German peace. There I explain the\\norigin and \
functions of the Revolutionary organisations, the evolution\\nof popular \
sentiment, the dissolution of the Constituent Assembly, the\\nstructure of \
the Soviet state, and the course and outcome of the\\nBrest-Litovsk \
negotiations....\\n\\nIn considering the rise of the Bolsheviki it is \
necessary to understand\\nthat Russian economic life and the Russian army \
were not disorganised\\non November 7th, 1917, but many months before, as the \
logical result of\\na process which began as far back as 1915. The corrupt \
reactionaries in\\ncontrol of the Tsar\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Court deliberately \
undertook to wreck Russia in\\norder to make a separate peace with Germany. \
The lack of arms on the\\nfront, which had caused the great retreat of the \
summer of 1915, the\\nlack of food in the army and in the great cities, the \
break-down of\\nmanufactures and transportation in 1916--all these we know \
now were part\\nof a gigantic campaign of sabotage. This was halted just in \
time by the\\nMarch Revolution.\\n\\nFor the first few months of the new r\
\[EAcute]gime, in spite of the confusion\\nincident upon a great Revolution, \
when one hundred and sixty millions\\nof the world\[CloseCurlyQuote]s most \
oppressed peoples suddenly achieved liberty, both\\nthe internal situation \
and the combative power of the army actually\\nimproved.\\n\\nBut the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]honeymoon\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was short. The \
propertied classes wanted merely a\\npolitical revolution, which would take \
the power from the Tsar and give\\nit to them. They wanted Russia to be a \
constitutional Republic, like\\nFrance or the United States; or a \
constitutional Monarchy, like\\nEngland. On the other hand, the masses of the \
people wanted real\\nindustrial and agrarian democracy.\\n\\nWilliam English \
Walling, in his book, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russia\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Message,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] an account of\\nthe Revolution of 1905, \
describes very well the state of mind of the\\nRussian workers, who were \
later to support Bolshevism almost\\nunanimously:\\n\\nThey (the working \
people) saw it was possible that even under a free\\nGovernment, if it fell \
into the hands of other social classes, they\\nmight still continue to \
starve....\\n\\nThe Russian workman is revolutionary, but he is neither \
violent,\\ndogmatic, nor unintelligent. He is ready for barricades, but he \
has\\nstudied them, and alone of the workers of the world he has \
learned\\nabout them from actual experience. He is ready and willing to fight \
his\\noppressor, the capitalist class, to a finish. But he does not \
ignore\\nthe existence of other classes. He merely asks that the other \
classes\\ntake one side or the other in the bitter conflict that draws \
near....\\n\\nThey (the workers) were all agreed that our (American) \
political\\ninstitutions were preferable to their own, but they were not very\
\\nanxious to exchange one despot for another (i.e., the \
capitalist\\nclass)....\\n\\nThe workingmen of Russia did not have themselves \
shot down, executed by\\nhundreds in Moscow, Riga and Odessa, imprisoned by \
thousands in every\\nRussian jail, and exiled to the deserts and the arctic \
regions, in\\nexchange for the doubtful privileges of the workingmen of \
Goldfields\\nand Cripple Creek....\\n\\nAnd so developed in Russia, in the \
midst of a foreign war, the Social\\nRevolution on top of the Political \
Revolution, culminating in the\\ntriumph of Bolshevism.\\n\\nMr. A. J. Sack, \
director in this country of the Russian Information\\nBureau, which opposes \
the Soviet Government, has this to say in his\\nbook, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Birth of the Russian Democracy\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]: The Bolsheviks organised\\ntheir own cabinet, with \
Nicholas Lenine as Premier and Leon\\nTrotsky--Minister of Foreign Affairs. \
The inevitability of their\\ncoming into power became evident almost \
immediately after the March\\nRevolution. The history of the Bolsheviki, \
after the Revolution,\\nis a history of their steady \
growth....\\n\\nForeigners, and Americans especially, frequently emphasise \
the\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ignorance\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of the Russian \
workers. It is true they lacked the\\npolitical experience of the peoples of \
the West, but they were very\\nwell trained in voluntary organisation. In \
1917 there were more than\\ntwelve million members of the Russian consumers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Cooperative societies;\\nand the Soviets themselves are a \
wonderful demonstration of their\\norganising genius. Moreover, there is \
probably not a people in the\\nworld so well educated in Socialist theory and \
its practical\\napplication.\\n\\nWilliam English Walling thus characterises \
them:\\n\\nThe Russian working people are for the most part able to read \
and\\nwrite. For many years the country has been in such a \
disturbed\\ncondition that they have had the advantage of leadership not only \
of\\nintelligent individuals in their midst, but of a large part of \
the\\nequally revolutionary educated class, who have turned to the \
working\\npeople with their ideas for the political and social regeneration \
of\\nRussia....\\n\\nMany writers explain their hostility to the Soviet \
Government by\\narguing that the last phase of the Russian Revolution was \
simply a\\nstruggle of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]respectable\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] elements against the brutal attacks of\\nBolshevism. \
However, it was the propertied classes, who, when they\\nrealised the growth \
in power of the popular revolutionary\\norganisations, undertook to destroy \
them and to halt the Revolution. To\\nthis end the propertied classes finally \
resorted to desperate measures.\\nIn order to wreck the Kerensky Ministry and \
the Soviets, transportation\\nwas disorganised and internal troubles \
provoked; to crush the\\nFactory-Shop Committees, plants were shut down, and \
fuel and raw\\nmaterials diverted; to break the Army Committees at the front, \
capital\\npunishment was restored and military defeat connived at.\\n\\nThis \
was all excellent fuel for the Bolshevik fire. The Bolsheviki\\nretorted by \
preaching the class war, and by asserting the supremacy of\\nthe \
Soviets.\\n\\nBetween these two extremes, with the other factions \
which\\nwhole-heartedly or half-heartedly supported them, were the \
so-called\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Socialists, the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries,\\nand several \
smaller parties. These groups were also attacked by the\\npropertied classes, \
but their power of resistance was crippled by their\\ntheories.\\n\\nRoughly, \
the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries believed that\\nRussia was not \
economically ripe for a social revolution--that only a\\n_political_ \
revolution was possible. According to their interpretation,\\nthe Russian \
masses were not educated enough to take over the power; any\\nattempt to do \
so would inevitably bring on a reaction, by means of\\nwhich some ruthless \
opportunist might restore the old r\[EAcute]gime. And so it\\nfollowed that \
when the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists \
were forced to assume the\\npower, they were afraid to use it.\\n\\nThey \
believed that Russia must pass through the stages of political and\\neconomic \
development known to Western Europe, and emerge at last, with\\nthe rest of \
the world, into full-fledged Socialism. Naturally,\\ntherefore, they agreed \
with the propertied classes that Russia must\\nfirst be a parliamentary \
state--though with some improvements on the\\nWestern democracies. As a \
consequence, they insisted upon the\\ncollaboration of the propertied classes \
in the Government.\\n\\nFrom this it was an easy step to supporting them. The \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nSocialists needed \
the bourgeoisie. But the bourgeoisie did not need the\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists. So it \
resulted in the Socialist Ministers being\\nobliged to give way, little by \
little, on their entire program, while\\nthe propertied classes grew more and \
more insistent.\\n\\nAnd at the end, when the Bolsheviki upset the whole \
hollow compromise,\\nthe Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries found \
themselves fighting\\non the side of the propertied classes.... In almost \
every country in the\\nworld to-day the same phenomenon is \
visible.\\n\\nInstead of being a destructive force, it seems to me that \
the\\nBolsheviki were the only party in Russia with a constructive \
program\\nand the power to impose it on the country. If they had not \
succeeded to\\nthe Government when they did, there is little doubt in my mind \
that the\\narmies of Imperial Germany would have been in Petrograd and Moscow \
in\\nDecember, and Russia would again be ridden by a Tsar....\\n\\nIt is \
still fashionable, after a whole year of the Soviet Government,\\nto speak of \
the Bolshevik insurrection as an \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]adventure.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Adventure it\\nwas, and one of the most marvellous \
mankind ever embarked upon,\\nsweeping into history at the head of the \
toiling masses, and staking\\neverything on their vast and simple desires. \
Already the machinery had\\nbeen set up by which the land of the great \
estates could be distributed\\namong the peasants. The Factory-Shop \
Committees and the Trade Unions\\nwere there to put into operation workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] control of industry. In every\\nvillage, town, city, \
district and province there were Soviets of\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote], \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, prepared \
to assume the task\\nof local administration.\\n\\nNo matter what one thinks \
of Bolshevism, it is undeniable that the\\nRussian Revolution is one of the \
great events of human history, and the\\nrise of the Bolsheviki a phenomenon \
of world-wide importance. Just as\\nhistorians search the records for the \
minutest details of the story of\\nthe Paris Commune, so they will want to \
know what happened in Petrograd\\nin November, 1917, the spirit which \
animated the people, and how the\\nleaders looked, talked and acted. It is \
with this in view that I have\\nwritten this book.\\n\\nIn the struggle my \
sympathies were not neutral. But in telling the\\nstory of those great days I \
have tried to see events with the eye of a\\nconscientious reporter, \
interested in setting down the truth.\\n\\n          J. R.\\n   New York, \
January 1st 1919.\\n\\n\\nNotes and Explanations\\n\\nTo the average reader \
the multiplicity of Russian organisations--political\\ngroups, Committees and \
Central Committees, Soviets, Dumas and\\nUnions--will prove extremely \
confusing. For this reason I am giving\\nhere a few brief definitions and \
explanations.\\n\\n\\nPolitical Parties\\n\\nIn the elections to the \
Constituent Assembly, there were seventeen\\ntickets in Petrograd, and in \
some of the provincial towns as many as\\nforty; but the following summary of \
the aims and composition of\\npolitical parties is limited to the groups and \
factions mentioned in\\nthis book. Only the essence of their programmes and \
the general\\ncharacter of their constituencies can be noticed....\\n\\n1. \
_Monarchists,_ of various shades, _Octobrists,_ etc. These\\nonce-powerful \
factions no longer existed openly; they either worked\\nunderground, or their \
members joined the _Cadets,_ as the _Cadets_\\ncame by degrees to stand for \
their political programme.\\nRepresentatives in this book, Rodzianko, \
Shulgin.\\n\\n2. _Cadets._ So-called from the initials of its name, \
Constitutional\\nDemocrats. Its official name is \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Party \
of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Freedom.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nUnder the \
Tsar composed of Liberals from the propertied classes,\\nthe _Cadets_ were \
the great party of _political_ reform, roughly\\ncorresponding to the \
Progressive Party in America. When the\\nRevolution broke out in March, 1917, \
the _Cadets_ formed the first\\nProvisional Government. The _Cadet_ Ministry \
was overthrown in April\\nbecause it declared itself in favour of Allied \
imperialistic aims,\\nincluding the imperialistic aims of the Tsar\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Government. As the\\nRevolution became more and more a \
_social economic_ Revolution, the\\n_Cadets_ grew more and more conservative. \
Its representatives in this\\nbook are: Miliukov, Vinaver, Shatsky.\\n\\n2a. \
_Group of Public Men._ After the _Cadets_ had become unpopular\\nthrough \
their relations with the Kornilov counter-revolution, the\\n_Group of Public \
Men_ was formed in Moscow. Delegates from the _Group\\nof Public Men_ were \
given portfolios in the last Kerensky Cabinet.\\nThe _Group_ declared itself \
non-partisan, although its intellectual\\nleaders were men like Rodzianko and \
Shulgin. It was composed of the\\nmore \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]modern\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] bankers, merchants and manufacturers, who \
were\\nintelligent enough to realise that the Soviets must be fought \
by\\ntheir own weapon--economic organisation. Typical of the \
_Group:_\\nLianozov, Konovalov.\\n\\n3. _Populist Socialists,_ or _Trudoviki_ \
(Labour Group). Numerically\\na small party, composed of cautious \
intellectuals, the leaders of\\nthe Cooperative societies, and conservative \
peasants. Professing\\nto be Socialists, the _Populists_ really supported the \
interests\\nof the petty bourgeoisie--clerks, shopkeepers, etc. By \
direct\\ndescent, inheritors of the compromising tradition of the \
Labour\\nGroup in the Fourth Imperial Duma, which was composed largely \
of\\npeasant representatives. Kerensky was the leader of the _Trudoviki_\\nin \
the Imperial Duma when the Revolution of March, 1917, broke out.\\nThe \
_Populist Socialists_ are a nationalistic party. Their\\nrepresentatives in \
this book are: Peshekhanov, Tchaikovsky.\\n\\n4. _Russian Social Democratic \
Labour Party._ Originally Marxian\\nSocialists. At a party congress held in \
1903, the party split, on the\\nquestion of tactics, into two factions--the \
Majority (Bolshinstvo),\\nand the Minority (Menshinstvo). From this sprang \
the names\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bolsheviki\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mensheviki\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]members of the majority\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]members\\nof the minority.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
These two wings became two separate parties, both\\ncalling themselves \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russian Social Democratic Labour Party,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and both\\nprofessing to be Marxians. Since the \
Revolution of 1905 the\\nBolsheviki were really the minority, becoming again \
the majority in\\nSeptember, 1917.\\n\\na. _Mensheviki._ This party includes \
all shades of Socialists who\\nbelieve that society must progress by natural \
evolution toward\\nSocialism, and that the working-class must conquer \
political power\\nfirst. Also a nationalistic party. This was the party of \
the\\nSocialist intellectuals, which means: all the means of \
education\\nhaving been in the hands of the propertied classes, the \
intellectuals\\ninstinctively reacted to their training, and took the side of \
the\\npropertied classes. Among their representatives in this book \
are:\\nDan, Lieber, Tseretelli.\\n\\nb. _Mensheviki Internationalists._ The \
radical wing of the\\n_Mensheviki,_ internationalists and opposed to all \
coalition with\\nthe propertied classes; yet unwilling to break loose from \
the\\nconservative Mensheviki, and opposed to the dictatorship of \
the\\nworking-class advocated by the Bolsheviki. Trotzky was long a \
member\\nof this group. Among their leaders: Martov, Martinov.\\n\\nc. \
_Bolsheviki._ Now call themselves the _Communist Party,_ in\\norder to \
emphasise their complete separation from the tradition\\nof \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]parliamentary\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialism, which \
dominates the\\nMensheviki and the so-called Majority Socialists in all \
countries.\\nThe _Bolsheviki_ proposed immediate proletarian insurrection, \
and\\nseizure of the reins of Government, in order to hasten the coming \
of\\nSocialism by forcibly taking over industry, land, natural \
resources\\nand financial institutions. This party expresses the desires \
chiefly\\nof the factory workers, but also of a large section of the \
poor\\npeasants. The name \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bolshevik\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] can _not_ be translated by \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Maximalist.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nThe Maximalists \
are a separate group. (See paragraph 5b). Among the\\nleaders: Lenin, \
Trotzky, Lunatcharsky.\\n\\nd. _United Social Democrats Internationalists._ \
Also called the\\n_Novaya Zhizn_ (New Life) group, from the name of the \
very\\ninfluential newspaper which was its organ. A little group \
of\\nintellectuals with a very small following among the \
working-class,\\nexcept the personal following of Maxim Gorky, its \
leader.\\nIntellectuals, with almost the same programme as the \
_Mensheviki\\nInternationalists,_ except that the _Novaya Zhizn_ group \
refused to\\nbe tied to either of the two great factions. Opposed the \
Bolshevik\\ntactics, but remained in the Soviet Government. Other \
representatives\\nin this book: Avilov, Kramarov.\\n\\ne. _Yedinstvo._ A very \
small and dwindling group, composed almost\\nentirely of the personal \
following of Plekhanov, one of the pioneers\\nof the Russian Social \
Democratic movement in the 80\[CloseCurlyQuote]s, and its\\ngreatest \
theoretician. Now an old man, Plekhanov was extremely\\npatriotic, too \
conservative even for the Mensheviki. After the\\nBolshevik _coup d\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]etat, Yedinstvo_ disappeared.\\n\\n5. _Socialist \
Revolutionary party._ Called _Essaires_ from the\\ninitials of their name. \
Originally the revolutionary party of the\\npeasants, the party of the \
Fighting Organisations--the Terrorists.\\nAfter the March Revolution, it was \
joined by many who had never been\\nSocialists. At that time it stood for the \
abolition of private\\nproperty in land only, the owners to be compensated in \
some fashion.\\nFinally the increasing revolutionary feeling of peasants \
forced the\\n_Essaires_ to abandon the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]compensation\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] clause, and led to the\\nyounger and more fiery \
intellectuals breaking off from the main party\\nin the fall of 1917 and \
forming a new party, the _Left Socialist\\nRevolutionary party._ The \
_Essaires,_ who were afterward always\\ncalled by the radical groups _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Right Socialist Revolutionaries,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\nadopted the political attitude of the Mensheviki, \
and worked together\\nwith them. They finally came to represent the wealthier \
peasants, the\\nintellectuals, and the politically uneducated populations of \
remote\\nrural districts. Among them there was, however, a wider difference \
of\\nshades of political and economic opinion than among the \
Mensheviki.\\nAmong their leaders mentioned in these pages: Avksentiev, Gotz,\
\\nKerensky, Tchernov, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Babuschka\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Breshkovskaya.\\n\\na. _Left Socialist \
Revolutionaries._ Although theoretically sharing\\nthe Bolshevik programme of \
dictatorship of the working-class, at\\nfirst were reluctant to follow the \
ruthless Bolshevik tactics.\\nHowever, the _Left Socialist Revolutionaries_ \
remained in the Soviet\\nGovernment, sharing the Cabinet portfolios, \
especially that of\\nAgriculture. They withdrew from the Government several \
times, but\\nalways returned. As the peasants left the ranks of the \
_Essaires_ in\\nincreasing numbers, they joined the _Left Socialist \
Revolutionary\\nparty,_ which became the great peasant party supporting the \
Soviet\\nGovernment, standing for confiscation without compensation of \
the\\ngreat landed estates, and their disposition by the \
peasants\\nthemselves. Among the leaders: Spiridonova, Karelin, \
Kamkov,\\nKalagayev.\\n\\nb. _Maximalists._ An off-shoot of the _Socialist \
Revolutionary\\nparty_ in the Revolution of 1905, when it was a powerful \
peasant\\nmovement, demanding the immediate application of the \
maximum\\nSocialist programme. Now an insignificant group of \
peasant\\nanarchists.\\n\\n\\nParliamentary Procedure\\n\\nRussian meetings \
and conventions are organised after the continental\\nmodel rather than our \
own. The first action is usually the election\\nof officers and the \
_presidium._\\n\\nThe _presidium_ is a presiding committee, composed of \
representatives\\nof the groups and political factions represented in the \
assembly,\\nin proportion to their numbers. The _presidium_ arranges the \
Order\\nof Business, and its members can be called upon by the President \
to\\ntake the chair _pro tem._\\n\\nEach question (_vopros_) is stated in a \
general way and then debated,\\nand at the close of the debate resolutions \
are submitted by the\\ndifferent factions, and each one voted on separately. \
The Order\\nof Business can be, and usually is, smashed to pieces in the \
first\\nhalf hour. On the plea of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]emergency,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] which the crowd almost always\\ngrants, anybody from \
the floor can get up and say anything on any\\nsubject. The crowd controls \
the meeting, practically the only\\nfunctions of the speaker being to keep \
order by ringing a little\\nbell, and to recognise speakers. Almost all the \
real work of the\\nsession is done in caucuses of the different groups and \
political\\nfactions, which almost always cast their votes in a body and \
are\\nrepresented by floor-leaders. The result is, however, that at \
every\\nimportant new point, or vote, the session takes a recess to \
enable\\nthe different groups and political factions to hold a \
caucus.\\n\\nThe crowd is extremely noisy, cheering or heckling \
speakers,\\nover-riding the plans of the _presidium._ Among the customary \
cries\\nare: _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Prosim!_ Please! Go on!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Pravilno!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ or _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Eto vierno!_\\nThat\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s true! Right!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do volno!_ Enough!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Doloi!_ Down with him!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n_\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Posor!_ Shame!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Teesche!_ Silence! Not so noisy!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\\nPopular Organisations\\n\\n1. _Soviet._ The \
word _soviet_ means \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]council.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Under the Tsar the\\nImperial Council of State was called _Gosudarstvennyi \
Soviet._ Since\\nthe Revolution, however, the term _Soviet_ has come to be \
associated\\nwith a certain type of parliament elected by members of \
working-class\\neconomic organisations--the Soviet of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], of Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote], or of\\nPeasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies. I have therefore limited the word to \
these\\nbodies, and wherever else it occurs I have translated it \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Council.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBesides the \
local _Soviets,_ elected in every city, town and\\nvillage of Russia--and in \
large cities, also Ward _(Raionny)\\nSoviets_--there are also the _oblastne_ \
or _gubiernsky_ (district or\\nprovincial) _Soviets,_ and the Central \
Executive Committee of the\\nAll-Russian _Soviets_ in the capital, called \
from its initials\\n_Tsay-ee-kah._ (See below, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Central \
Committees\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]).\\n\\nAlmost everywhere the _Soviets_ of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and of Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies \
combined very soon after the March Revolution. In special\\nmatters \
concerning their peculiar interests, however, the \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand the Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Sections \
continued to meet separately. The\\n_Soviets_ of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies did not join the other two until\\nafter the Bolshevik _coup d\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]etat._ They, too, were organised like the\\nworkers and \
soldiers, with an Executive Committee of the All-Russian\\nPeasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] _Soviets_ in the capital.\\n\\n2. _Trade Unions._ Although \
mostly industrial in form, the Russian\\nlabour unions were still called \
Trade Unions, and at the time of the\\nBolshevik Revolution had from three to \
four million members. These\\nUnions were also organised in an All-Russian \
body, a sort of Russian\\nFederation of Labour, which had its Central \
Executive Committee in\\nthe capital.\\n\\n3. _Factory-Shop Committees._ \
These were spontaneous organisations\\ncreated in the factories by the \
workers in their attempt to control\\nindustry, taking advantage of the \
administrative break-down incident\\nupon the Revolution. Their function was \
by revolutionary action to\\ntake over and run the factories. The \
_Factory-Shop Committees_ also\\nhad their All-Russian organisation, with a \
Central Committee at\\nPetrograd, which co-operated with the Trade Unions.\\n\
\\n4. _Dumas._ The word _duma_ means roughly \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]deliberative body.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The\\nold \
Imperial Duma, which persisted six months after the Revolution,\\nin a \
democratised form, died a natural death in September, 1917. The\\n_City Duma_ \
referred to in this book was the reorganised Municipal\\nCouncil, often \
called \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Municipal Self-Government.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It was elected by\\ndirect and secret ballot, and \
its only reason for failure to hold the\\nmasses during the Bolshevik \
Revolution was the general decline in\\ninfluence of all purely _political_ \
representation in the fact of the\\ngrowing power of organisations based on \
_economic_ groups.\\n\\n5. _Zemstvos._ May be roughly translated \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]county councils.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Under\\nthe \
Tsar semi-political, semi-social bodies with very little\\nadministrative \
power, developed and controlled largely by\\nintellectual Liberals among the \
land-owning classes. Their most\\nimportant function was education and social \
service among the\\npeasants. During the war the _Zemstvos_ gradually took \
over the\\nentire feeding and clothing of the Russian Army, as well as \
the\\nbuying from foreign countries, and work among the soldiers \
generally\\ncorresponding to the work of the American Y. M. C. A. at the \
Front.\\nAfter the March Revolution the _Zemstvos_ were democratized, with \
a\\nview to making them the organs of local government in the \
rural\\ndistricts. But like the _City Dumas,_ they could not compete with the\
\\n_Soviets._\\n\\n6. _Cooperatives._ These were the \
workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Consumers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nCooperative societies, which had several million members \
all over\\nRussia before the Revolution. Founded by Liberals and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nSocialists, the \
Cooperative movement was not supported by the\\nrevolutionary Socialist \
groups, because it was a substitute for the\\ncomplete transference of means \
of production and distribution into\\nthe hands of the workers. After the \
March Revolution the\\n_Cooperatives_ spread rapidly, and were dominated by \
Populist\\nSocialists, Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries, and acted as \
a\\nconservative political force until the Bolshevik Revolution. \
However,\\nit was the _Cooperatives_ which fed Russia when the old structure \
of\\ncommerce and transportation collapsed.\\n\\n7. _Army Committees._ The \
_Army Committees_ were formed by the\\nsoldiers at the front to combat the \
reactionary influence of the old\\nregime officers. Every company, regiment, \
brigade, division and corps\\nhad its committee, over all of which was \
elected the _Army\\nCommittee._ The _Central Army Committee_ cooperated with \
the General\\nStaff. The administrative break-down in the army incident upon \
the\\nRevolution threw upon the shoulders of the _Army Committees_ most \
of\\nthe work of the Quartermaster\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Department, and in some \
cases, even\\nthe command of troops.\\n\\n8. _Fleet Committees._ The \
corresponding organisations in the Navy.\\n\\n\\nCentral Committees\\n\\nIn \
the spring and summer of 1917, All-Russian conventions of every\\nsort of \
organisation were held at Petrograd. There were national\\ncongresses of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, Trade\\nUnions, Factory-Shop Committees, Army and \
Fleet Committees--besides\\nevery branch of the military and naval service, \
Cooperatives,\\nNationalities, etc. Each of these conventions elected a \
Central\\nCommittee, or a Central Executive Committee, to guard its \
particular\\ninterests at the seat of Government. As the Provisional \
Government\\ngrew weaker, these Central Committees were forced to assume more \
and\\nmore administrative powers.\\n\\nThe most important Central Committees \
mentioned in this book are:\\n\\n_Union of Unions._ During the Revolution of \
1905, Professor\\nMiliukov and other Liberals established unions of \
professional\\nmen--doctors, lawyers, physicians, etc. These were united \
under one\\ncentral organisation, the _Union of Unions._ In 1905 the _Union \
of\\nUnions_ acted with the revolutionary democracy; in 1917, however, \
the\\n_Union of Unions_ opposed the Bolshevik uprising, and united \
the\\nGovernment employees who went on strike against the authority of \
the\\nSoviets.\\n\\n_Tsay-ee-kah._ All-Russian Central Executive Committee of \
the\\nSoviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies. So called from the\\ninitials of its name.\\n\\n_Tsentroflot._ \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Centre-Fleet\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--the Central \
Fleet Committee.\\n\\n_Vikzhel._ All-Russian Central Committee of the Railway \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nUnion. So called from the initials of its \
name.\\n\\nOther Organisations\\n\\n_Red Guards._ The armed factory workers \
of Russia. The _Red Guards_\\nwere first formed during the Revolution of \
1905, and sprang into\\nexistence again in the days of March, 1917, when a \
force was needed\\nto keep order in the city. At that time they were armed, \
and all\\nefforts of the Provisional Government to disarm them were more \
or\\nless unsuccessful. At every great crisis in the Revolution the \
_Red\\nGuards_ appeared on the streets, untrained and undisciplined, \
but\\nfull of Revolutionary zeal.\\n\\n\\n_White Guards._ Bourgeois \
volunteers, who emerged in the last\\nstages of the Revolution, to defend \
private property from the\\nBolshevik attempt to abolish it. A great many of \
them were University\\nstudents.\\n\\n_Tekhintsi._ The so-called \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Savage Division\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in the army, \
made up\\nof Mohametan tribesmen from Central Asia, and personally devoted to\
\\nGeneral Kornilov. The _Tekhintsi_ were noted for their blind\\nobedience \
and their savage cruelty in warfare.\\n\\n_Death Battalions._ Or _Shock \
Battalions._ The Women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Battalion is\\nknown to the world \
as the _Death Battalion,_ but there were many\\n_Death Battalions_ composed \
of men. These were formed in the summer\\nof 1917 by Kerensky, for the \
purpose of strengthening the discipline\\nand combative fire of the army by \
heroic example. The _Death\\nBattalions_ were composed mostly of intense \
young patriots. These\\ncame for the most part from among the sons of the \
propertied classes.\\n\\n_Union of Officers._ An organisation formed among \
the reactionary\\nofficers in the army to combat politically the growing \
power of the\\nArmy Committees.\\n\\n_Knights of St. George._ The Cross of \
St. George was awarded for\\ndistinguished action in battle. Its holder \
automatically became a\\n_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Knight of St. George.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ The predominant influence in the\\norganisation was \
that of the supporters of the military idea.\\n\\n_Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Union._ In 1905, the _Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Union_ was a\\nrevolutionary \
peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] organisation. In 1917, however, it had \
become\\nthe political expression of the more prosperous peasants, to \
fight\\nthe growing power and revolutionary aims of the Soviets of Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies.\\n\\n\\nChronology and Spelling\\n\\nI have \
adopted in this book our Calendar throughout, instead of the\\nformer Russian \
Calendar, which was thirteen days earlier.\\n\\nIn the spelling of Russian \
names and words, I have made no attempt\\nto follow any scientific rules for \
transliteration, but have tried to\\ngive the spelling which would lead the \
English-speaking reader to the\\nsimplest approximation of their \
pronunciation.\\n\\n\\nSources\\n\\nMuch of the material in this book is from \
my own notes. I have also\\nrelied, however, upon a heterogeneous file of \
several hundred\\nassorted Russian newspapers, covering almost every day of \
the time\\ndescribed, of files of the English paper, the _Russian Daily \
News,_\\nand of the two French papers, _Journal de Russie_ and _Entente._ But\
\\nfar more valuable than these is the _Bulletin de la Presse_ issued\\ndaily \
by the French Information Bureau in Petrograd, which reports\\nall important \
happenings, speeches and the comment of the Russian\\npress. Of this I have \
an almost complete file from the spring of 1917\\nto the end of January, \
1918.\\n\\nBesides the foregoing, I have in my possession almost \
every\\nproclamation, decree and announcement posted on the walls \
of\\nPetrograd from the middle of September, 1917, to the end of \
January,\\n1918. Also the official publication of all Government decrees \
and\\norders, and the official Government publication of the \
secret\\ntreaties and other documents discovered in the Ministry of \
Foreign\\nAffairs when the Bolsheviki took it over.\\n\\n\\n\\nTen Days That \
Shook The World\\n\\n\\nChapter I\\n\\nBackground\\n\\n\\nToward the end of \
September, 1917, an alien Professor of Sociology\\nvisiting Russia came to \
see me in Petrograd. He had been informed by\\nbusiness men and intellectuals \
that the Revolution was slowing down.\\nThe Professor wrote an article about \
it, and then travelled around\\nthe country, visiting factory towns and \
peasant communities--where, to\\nhis astonishment, the Revolution seemed to \
be speeding up. Among the\\nwage-earners and the land-working people it was \
common to hear talk\\nof \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all land to the peasants, all \
factories to the workers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] If the\\nProfessor had \
visited the front, he would have heard the whole Army\\ntalking \
Peace....\\n\\nThe Professor was puzzled, but he need not have been; \
both\\nobservations were correct. The property-owning classes were \
becoming\\nmore conservative, the masses of the people more \
radical.\\n\\nThere was a feeling among business men and the _intelligentzia_\
\\ngenerally that the Revolution had gone quite far enough, and lasted\\ntoo \
long; that things should settle down. This sentiment was shared\\nby the \
dominant \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist \
groups, the _oborontsi_ (See\\nApp. I, Sect. 1) Mensheviki and Socialist \
Revolutionaries, who\\nsupported the Provisional Government of \
Kerensky.\\n\\nOn October 14th the official organ of the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists \
said:\\n\\nThe drama of Revolution has two acts; the destruction of the \
old\\nr\[EAcute]gime and the creation of the new one. The first act has \
lasted long\\nenough. Now it is time to go on to the second, and to play it \
as\\nrapidly as possible. As a great revolutionist put it, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let us hasten,\\nfriends, to terminate the Revolution. \
He who makes it last too long\\nwill not gather the fruits....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAmong the worker, soldier and peasant masses, \
however, there was a\\nstubborn feeling that the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]first \
act\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was not yet played out. On the\\nfront the Army \
Committees were always running foul of officers who\\ncould not get used to \
treating their men like human beings; in the\\nrear the Land Committees \
elected by the peasants were being jailed\\nfor trying to carry out \
Government regulations concerning the land;\\nand the workmen (See App. I, \
Sect. 2) in the factories were fighting\\nblack-lists and lockouts. Nay, \
furthermore, returning political\\nexiles were being excluded from the \
country as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]undesirable\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\ncitizens; and in \
some cases, men who returned from abroad to their\\nvillages were prosecuted \
and imprisoned for revolutionary acts\\ncommitted in 1905.\\n\\nTo the \
multiform discontent of the people the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists\\nhad one answer: Wait for the \
Constituent Assembly, which is to meet\\nin December. But the masses were not \
satisfied with that. The\\nConstituent Assembly was all well and good; but \
there were certain\\ndefinite things for which the Russian Revolution had \
been made, and\\nfor which the revolutionary martyrs rotted in their stark \
Brotherhood\\nGrave on Mars Field, that must be achieved Constituent Assembly \
or no\\nConstituent Assembly: Peace, Land, and Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Control of Industry.\\nThe Constituent Assembly had been postponed and \
postponed--would\\nprobably be postponed again, until the people were \
calm\\nenough--perhaps to modify their demands! At any rate, here were \
eight\\nmonths of the Revolution gone, and little enough to show for \
it....\\n\\nMeanwhile the soldiers began to solve the peace question by \
simply\\ndeserting, the peasants burned manor-houses and took over the \
great\\nestates, the workers sabotaged and struck.... Of course, as \
was\\nnatural, the manufacturers, land-owners and army officers exerted \
all\\ntheir influence against any democratic compromise....\\n\\nThe policy \
of the Provisional Government alternated between\\nineffective reforms and \
stern repressive measures. An edict from the\\nSocialist Minister of Labour \
ordered all the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees\\nhenceforth to meet \
only after working hours. Among the troops at the\\nfront, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]agitators\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of opposition \
political parties were arrested,\\nradical newspapers closed down, and \
capital punishment applied--to\\nrevolutionary propagandists. Attempts were \
made to disarm the Red\\nGuard. Cossacks were sent to keep order in the \
provinces....\\n\\nThese measures were supported by the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists and \
their\\nleaders in the Ministry, who considered it necessary to \
cooperate\\nwith the propertied classes. The people rapidly deserted them, \
and\\nwent over to the Bolsheviki, who stood for Peace, Land, and Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nControl of Industry, and a Government of the \
working-class. In\\nSeptember, 1917, matters reached a crisis. Against the \
overwhelming\\nsentiment of the country, Kerensky and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Socialists\\nsucceeded in establishing a Government of Coalition with \
the\\npropertied classes; and as a result, the Mensheviki and \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries lost the confidence of the people \
forever.\\n\\nAn article in _Rabotchi Put_ (Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Way) \
about the middle of\\nOctober, entitled \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Socialist \
Ministers,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] expressed the feeling of\\nthe masses of \
the people against the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists:\\n\\nHere \
is a list of their services.(See App. I, Sect. 3)\\n\\nTseretelli: disarmed \
the workmen with the assistance of General\\nPolovtsev, checkmated the \
revolutionary soldiers, and approved of\\ncapital punishment in the \
army.\\n\\nSkobeliev: commenced by trying to tax the capitalists 100% of \
their\\nprofits, and finished--and finished by an attempt to dissolve \
the\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees in the shops and \
factories.\\n\\nAvksentiev: put several hundred peasants in prison, members \
of the\\nLand Committees, and suppressed dozens of workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
and soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nnewspapers.\\n\\nTchernov: signed the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Imperial\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] manifest, ordering \
the dissolution of\\nthe Finnish Diet.\\n\\nSavinkov: concluded an open \
alliance with General Kornilov. If this\\nsaviour of the country was not able \
to betray Petrograd, it was due\\nto reasons over which he had no control.\\n\
\\nZarudny: with the sanction of Alexinsky and Kerensky, put some of \
the\\nbest workers of the Revolution, soldiers and sailors, in \
prison.\\n\\nNikitin: acted as a vulgar policeman against the Railway \
Workers.\\n\\nKerensky: it is better not to say anything about him. The list \
of his\\nservices is too long....\\n\\nA Congress of delegates of the Baltic \
Fleet, at Helsingfors, passed a\\nresolution which began as follows:\\n\\nWe \
demand the immediate removal from the ranks of the Provisional\\nGovernment \
of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Socialist,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the \
political adventurer--Kerensky, as\\none who is scandalising and ruining the \
great Revolution, and with it\\nthe revolutionary masses, by his shameless \
political blackmail on\\nbehalf of the bourgeoisie....\\n\\nThe direct result \
of all this was the rise of the Bolsheviki....\\n\\nSince March, 1917, when \
the roaring torrents of workmen and soldiers\\nbeating upon the Tauride \
Palace compelled the reluctant Imperial Duma\\nto assume the supreme power in \
Russia, it was the masses of the\\npeople, workers, soldiers and peasants, \
which forced every change in\\nthe course of the Revolution. They hurled the \
Miliukov Ministry down;\\nit was their Soviet which proclaimed to the world \
the Russian peace\\nterms--\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No annexations, no \
indemnities, and the right of\\nself-determination of peoples\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; and again, in July, it was the\\nspontaneous rising \
of the unorganised proletariat which once more\\nstormed the Tauride Palace, \
to demand that the Soviets take over the\\nGovernment of Russia.\\n\\nThe \
Bolsheviki, then a small political sect, put themselves at the\\nhead of the \
movement. As a result of the disastrous failure of the\\nrising, public \
opinion turned against them, and their leaderless\\nhordes slunk back into \
the Viborg Quarter, which is Petrograd\[CloseCurlyQuote]s _St.\\nAntoine._ \
Then followed a savage hunt of the Bolsheviki; hundreds\\nwere imprisoned, \
among them Trotzky, Madame Kollontai and Kameniev;\\nLenin and Zinoviev went \
into hiding, fugitives from justice; the\\nBolshevik papers were suppressed. \
Provocators and reactionaries\\nraised the cry that the Bolsheviki were \
German agents, until people\\nall over the world believed it.\\n\\nBut the \
Provisional Government found itself unable to substantiate\\nits accusations; \
the documents proving pro-German conspiracy were\\ndiscovered to be \
forgeries;[1] and one by one the Bolsheviki were\\nreleased from prison \
without trial, on nominal or no bail-until only\\nsix remained. The impotence \
and indecision of the ever-changing\\nProvisional Government was an argument \
nobody could refute. The\\nBolsheviki raised again the slogan so dear to the \
masses, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All Power\\nto the Soviets!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--and they were not merely self-seeking, for at \
that\\ntime the majority of the Soviets was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist, their\\nbitter enemy.\\n\\n[1] Part of \
the famous \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Sisson \
Documents\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote].\\n\\nBut more potent still, they took the \
crude, simple desires of the\\nworkers, soldiers and peasants, and from them \
built their immediate\\nprogramme. And so, while the _oborontsi_ Mensheviki \
and Socialist\\nRevolutionaries involved themselves in compromise with \
the\\nbourgeoisie, the Bolsheviki rapidly captured the Russian masses. \
In\\nJuly they were hunted and despised; by September the \
metropolitan\\nworkmen, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet, and the soldiers, \
had been\\nwon almost entirely to their cause. The September municipal \
elections\\nin the large cities (See App. I, Sect. 4) were significant; only \
18\\nper cent of the returns were Menshevik and Socialist \
Revolutionary,\\nagainst more than 70 per cent in June....\\n\\nThere remains \
a phenomenon which puzzled foreign observers: the fact\\nthat the Central \
Executive Committees of the Soviets, the Central\\nArmy and Fleet \
Committees,[2] and the Central Committees of some of\\nthe Unions--notably, \
the Post and Telegraph Workers and the Railway\\nWorkers--opposed the \
Bolsheviki with the utmost violence. These\\nCentral Committees had all been \
elected in the middle of the summer,\\nor even before, when the Mensheviki \
and Socialist Revolutionaries had\\nan enormous following; and they delayed \
or prevented any new\\nelections. Thus, according to the constitution of the \
Soviets of\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies, the All-Russian Congress _should\\nhave been called in September;_ \
but the _Tsay-ee-kah_[2] would not\\ncall the meeting, on the ground that the \
Constituent Assembly was\\nonly two months away, at which time, they hinted, \
the Soviets would\\nabdicate. Meanwhile, one by one, the Bolsheviki were \
winning in the\\nlocal Soviets all over the country, in the Union branches \
and the\\nranks of the soldiers and sailors. The Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Soviets remained\\nstill conservative, because in the sluggish rural \
districts political\\nconsciousness developed slowly, and the Socialist \
Revolutionary party\\nhad been for a generation the party which had agitated \
among the\\npeasants.... But even among the peasants a revolutionary wing was\
\\nforming. It showed itself clearly in October, when the left wing of\\nthe \
Socialist Revolutionaries split off, and formed a new political\\nfaction, \
the Left Socialist Revolutionaries.\\n\\n[2] See Notes and \
Explanations.\\n\\nAt the same time there were signs everywhere that the \
forces of\\nreaction were gaining confidence.(See App. I, Sect. 5) At \
the\\nTroitsky Farce theatre in Petrograd, for example, a burlesque \
called\\n_Sins of the Tsar_ was interrupted by a group of Monarchists, \
who\\nthreatened to lynch the actors for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]insulting the \
Emperor.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Certain\\nnewspapers began to sigh for a \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russian Napoleon.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It was the \
usual\\nthing among bourgeois _intelligentzia_ to refer to the Soviets \
of\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies (Rabotchikh Deputatov) as \
_Sabatchikh_\\nDeputatov--Dogs\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\nOn October \
15th I had a conversation with a great Russian capitalist,\\nStepan \
Georgevitch Lianozov, known as the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russian Rockefeller\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--a\\nCadet by political faith.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Revolution,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is a sickness. Sooner or later the foreign\\npowers \
must intervene here--as one would intervene to cure a sick\\nchild, and teach \
it how to walk. Of course it would be more or less\\nimproper, but the \
nations must realise the danger of Bolshevism in\\ntheir own countries--such \
contagious ideas as \[OpenCurlyQuote]proletarian\\ndictatorship,\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \[OpenCurlyQuote]world social revolution\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]... There is a chance that\\nthis intervention may not be \
necessary. Transportation is\\ndemoralised, the factories are closing down, \
and the Germans are\\nadvancing. Starvation and defeat may bring the Russian \
people to\\ntheir senses....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nMr. Lianozov was \
emphatic in his opinion that whatever happened, it\\nwould be impossible for \
merchants and manufacturers to permit the\\nexistence of the workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Shop Committees, or to allow the workers\\nany share in \
the management of industry.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As for the \
Bolsheviki, they will be done away with by one of two\\nmethods. The \
Government can evacuate Petrograd, then a state of siege\\ndeclared, and the \
military commander of the district can deal with\\nthese gentlemen without \
legal formalities.... _Or if, for example, the\\nConstituent Assembly \
manifests any Utopian tendencies, it can be\\ndispersed by force of arms....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n\\nWinter was coming on--the terrible Russian \
winter. I heard business\\nmen speak of it so: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Winter \
was always Russia\[CloseCurlyQuote]s best friend. Perhaps\\nnow it will rid \
us of Revolution.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] On the freezing front \
miserable\\narmies continued to starve and die, without enthusiasm. The \
railways\\nwere breaking down, food lessening, factories closing. The \
desperate\\nmasses cried out that the bourgeoisie was sabotaging the life of \
the\\npeople, causing defeat on the Front. Riga had been surrendered \
just\\nafter General Kornilov said publicly, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Must we \
pay with Riga the\\nprice of bringing the country to a sense of its duty?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote][3]\\n\\n[3] See \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov to \
Brest-Litovsk\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] by John Reed. Boni and \
Liveright\\nN.Y., 1919.\\n\\nTo Americans it is incredible that the class war \
should develop to\\nsuch a pitch. But I have personally met officers on the \
Northern\\nFront who frankly preferred military disaster to cooperation with \
the\\nSoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees. The secretary of the Petrograd \
branch of the\\nCadet party told me that the break-down of the country\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s economic\\nlife was part of a campaign to discredit the \
Revolution. An Allied\\ndiplomat, whose name I promised not to mention, \
confirmed this from\\nhis own knowledge. I know of certain coal-mines near \
Kharkov which\\nwere fired and flooded by their owners, of textile factories \
at\\nMoscow whose engineers put the machinery out of order when they \
left,\\nof railroad officials caught by the workers in the act of \
crippling\\nlocomotives....\\n\\nA large section of the propertied classes \
preferred the Germans to\\nthe Revolution--even to the Provisional \
Government--and didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hesitate\\nto say so. In the Russian \
household where I lived, the subject of\\nconversation at the dinner table \
was almost invariably the coming of\\nthe Germans, bringing \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]law and order.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... One evening \
I spent at the\\nhouse of a Moscow merchant; during tea we asked the eleven \
people at\\nthe table whether they preferred \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Wilhelm \
or the Bolsheviki.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The\\nvote was ten to one for \
Wilhelm...\\n\\nThe speculators took advantage of the universal \
disorganisation to\\npile up fortunes, and to spend them in fantastic revelry \
or the\\ncorruption of Government officials. Foodstuffs and fuel were \
hoarded,\\nor secretly sent out of the country to Sweden. In the first \
four\\nmonths of the Revolution, for example, the reserve food-supplies \
were\\nalmost openly looted from the great Municipal warehouses \
of\\nPetrograd, until the two-years\[CloseCurlyQuote] provision of grain had \
fallen to less\\nthan enough to feed the city for one month.... According to \
the\\nofficial report of the last Minister of Supplies in the \
Provisional\\nGovernment, coffee was bought wholesale in Vladivostok for two \
rubles\\na pound, and the consumer in Petrograd paid thirteen. In all \
the\\nstores of the large cities were tons of food and clothing; but \
only\\nthe rich could buy them.\\n\\nIn a provincial town I knew a merchant \
family turned\\nspeculator--_maradior_ (bandit, ghoul) the Russians call it. \
The three\\nsons had bribed their way out of military service. One gambled in\
\\nfoodstuffs. Another sold illegal gold from the Lena mines to\\nmysterious \
parties in Finland. The third owned a controlling interest\\nin a chocolate \
factory, which supplied the local Cooperative\\nsocieties--on condition that \
the Cooperatives furnished him everything\\nhe needed. And so, while the \
masses of the people got a quarter pound\\nof black bread on their bread \
cards, he had an abundance of white\\nbread, sugar, tea, candy, cake and \
butter.... Yet when the soldiers at\\nthe front could no longer fight from \
cold, hunger and exhaustion, how\\nindignantly did this family scream \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Cowards!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--how \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ashamed\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they were\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to be Russians\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... When finally \
the Bolsheviki found and requisitioned\\nvast hoarded stores of provisions, \
what \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Robbers\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they \
were.\\n\\nBeneath all this external rottenness moved the old-time Dark \
Forces,\\nunchanged since the fall of Nicholas the Second, secret still \
and\\nvery active. The agents of the notorious _Okhrana_ still \
functioned,\\nfor and against the Tsar, for and against Kerensky--whoever \
would\\npay.... In the darkness, underground organisations of all sorts, such\
\\nas the Black Hundreds, were busy attempting to restore reaction in\\nsome \
form or other.\\n\\nIn this atmosphere of corruption, of monstrous \
half-truths, one clear\\nnote sounded day after day, the deepening chorus of \
the Bolsheviki,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All Power to the Soviets! All power \
to the direct representatives of\\nmillions on millions of common workers, \
soldiers, peasants. Land,\\nbread, an end to the senseless war, an end to \
secret diplomacy,\\nspeculation, treachery.... The Revolution is in danger, \
and with it\\nthe cause of the people all over the world!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe struggle between the proletariat and the \
middle class, between\\nthe Soviets and the Government, which had begun in \
the first March\\ndays, was about to culminate. Having at one bound leaped \
from the\\nMiddle Ages into the twentieth century, Russia showed the startled\
\\nworld two systems of Revolution--the political and the social--in\\nmortal \
combat.\\n\\nWhat a revelation of the vitality of the Russian Revolution, \
after\\nall these months of starvation and disillusionment! The \
bourgeoisie\\nshould have better known its Russia. Not for a long time in \
Russia\\nwill the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sickness\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of \
Revolution have run its course....\\n\\nLooking back, Russia before the \
November insurrection seems of\\nanother age, almost incredibly conservative. \
So quickly did we adapt\\nourselves to the newer, swifter life; just as \
Russian politics swung\\nbodily to the Left--until the Cadets were outlawed \
as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]enemies of the\\npeople,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Kerensky became a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]counter-revolutionist,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]middle\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nSocialist leaders, Tseretelli, Dan, Lieber, Gotz \
and Avksentiev, were\\ntoo reactionary for their following, and men like \
Victor Tchernov,\\nand even Maxim Gorky, belonged to the Right \
Wing....\\n\\nAbout the middle of December, 1917, a group of \
Socialist\\nRevolutionary leaders paid a private visit to Sir George \
Buchanan,\\nthe British Ambassador, and implored him not to mention the fact \
that\\nthey had been there, because they were \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]considered too far \
Right.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And to think,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Sir George. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]One year ago \
my Government\\ninstructed me not to receive Miliukov, because he was so \
dangerously\\nLeft!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSeptember and October are \
the worst months of the Russian\\nyear--especially the Petrograd year. Under \
dull grey skies, in the\\nshortening days, the rain fell drenching, \
incessant. The mud\\nunderfoot was deep, slippery and clinging, tracked \
everywhere by\\nheavy boots, and worse than usual because of the complete \
break-down\\nof the Municipal administration. Bitter damp winds rushed in \
from the\\nGulf of Finland, and the chill fog rolled through the streets. \
At\\nnight, for motives of economy as well as fear of Zeppelins, \
the\\nstreet-lights were few and far between; in private dwellings \
and\\napartment-houses the electricity was turned on from six o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock until\\nmidnight, with candles forty cents apiece and \
little kerosene to be\\nhad. It was dark from three in the afternoon to ten \
in the morning.\\nRobberies and housebreakings increased. In apartment houses \
the men\\ntook turns at all-night guard duty, armed with loaded rifles. \
This\\nwas under the Provisional Government.\\n\\nWeek by week food became \
scarcer. The daily allowance of bread fell\\nfrom a pound and a half to a \
pound, then three quarters, half, and a\\nquarter-pound. Toward the end there \
was a week without any bread at\\nall. Sugar one was entitled to at the rate \
of two pounds a month--if\\none could get it at all, which was seldom. A bar \
of chocolate or a\\npound of tasteless candy cost anywhere from seven to ten \
rubles--at\\nleast a dollar. There was milk for about half the babies in the \
city;\\nmost hotels and private houses never saw it for months. In the \
fruit\\nseason apples and pears sold for a little less than a ruble apiece on\
\\nthe street-corner....\\n\\nFor milk and bread and sugar and tobacco one \
had to stand in _queue_\\nlong hours in the chill rain. Coming home from an \
all-night meeting I\\nhave seen the _kvost_ (tail) beginning to form before \
dawn, mostly\\nwomen, some with babies in their arms.... Carlyle, in his \
_French\\nRevolution,_ has described the French people as distinguished above\
\\nall others by their faculty of standing in _queue._ Russia \
had\\naccustomed herself to the practice, begun in the reign of \
Nicholas\\nthe Blessed as long ago as 1915, and from then \
continued\\nintermittently until the summer of 1917, when it settled down as \
the\\nregular order of things. Think of the poorly-clad people standing \
on\\nthe iron-white streets of Petrograd whole days in the Russian \
winter!\\nI have listened in the bread-lines, hearing the bitter, acrid note \
of\\ndiscontent which from time to time burst up through the \
miraculous\\ngoodnature of the Russian crowd....\\n\\nOf course all the \
theatres were going every night, including Sundays.\\nKarsavina appeared in a \
new Ballet at the Marinsky, all dance-loving\\nRussia coming to see her. \
Shaliapin was singing. At the Alexandrinsky\\nthey were reviving Meyerhold\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s production of Tolstoy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Death of Ivan\\nthe Terrible\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; \
and at that performance I remember noticing a student\\nof the Imperial \
School of Pages, in his dress uniform, who stood up\\ncorrectly between the \
acts and faced the empty Imperial box, with its\\neagles all erased.... The \
_Krivoye Zerkalo_ staged a sumptuous version\\nof \
Schnitzler\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Reigen.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAlthough the Hermitage and other picture \
galleries had been evacuated\\nto Moscow, there were weekly exhibitions of \
paintings. Hordes of the\\nfemale _intelligentzia_ went to hear lectures on \
Art, Literature and\\nthe Easy Philosophies. It was a particularly active \
season for\\nTheosophists. And the Salvation Army, admitted to Russia for the\
\\nfirst time in history, plastered the walls with announcements of\\ngospel \
meetings, which amused and astounded Russian audiences....\\n\\nAs in all \
such times, the petty conventional life of the city went\\non, ignoring the \
Revolution as much as possible. The poets made\\nverses--but not about the \
Revolution. The realistic painters painted\\nscenes from medi\[AE]val Russian \
history--anything but the Revolution.\\nYoung ladies from the provinces came \
up to the capital to learn\\nFrench and cultivate their voices, and the gay \
young beautiful\\nofficers wore their gold-trimmed crimson _bashliki_ and \
their\\nelaborate Caucasian swords around the hotel lobbies. The ladies \
of\\nthe minor bureaucratic set took tea with each other in the \
afternoon,\\ncarrying each her little gold or silver or jewelled sugar-box, \
and\\nhalf a loaf of bread in her muff, and wished that the Tsar were \
back,\\nor that the Germans would come, or anything that would solve \
the\\nservant problem.... The daughter of a friend of mine came home \
one\\nafternoon in hysterics because the woman street-car conductor \
had\\ncalled her \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrade!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAll around them \
great Russia was in travail, bearing a new world. The\\nservants one used to \
treat like animals and pay next to nothing, were\\ngetting independent. A \
pair of shoes cost more than a hundred rubles,\\nand as wages averaged about \
thirty-five rubles a month the servants\\nrefused to stand in _queue_ and \
wear out their shoes. But more than\\nthat. In the new Russia every man and \
woman could vote; there were\\nworking-class newspapers, saying new and \
startling things; there were\\nthe Soviets; and there were the Unions. The \
_izvoshtchiki_\\n(cab-drivers) had a Union; they were also represented in the\
\\nPetrograd Soviet. The waiters and hotel servants were organised, \
and\\nrefused tips. On the walls of restaurants they put up signs \
which\\nread, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No tips taken here--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Just because a man has to \
make his\\nliving waiting on table is no reason to insult him by offering him \
a\\ntip!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt the Front the soldiers fought out \
their fight with the officers,\\nand learned self-government through their \
committees. In the\\nfactories those unique Russian organisations, the \
Factory-Shop\\nCommittees,[4] gained experience and strength and a \
realisation of\\ntheir historical mission by combat with the old order. All \
Russia was\\nlearning to read, and _reading_--politics, economics, \
history--because\\nthe people wanted to _know...._ In every city, in most \
towns, along the\\nFront, each political faction had its newspaper--sometimes \
several.\\nHundreds of thousands of pamphlets were distributed by thousands \
of\\norganisations, and poured into the armies, the villages, \
the\\nfactories, the streets. The thirst for education, so long \
thwarted,\\nburst with the Revolution into a frenzy of expression. From \
Smolny\\nInstitute alone, the first six months, went out every day \
tons,\\ncar-loads, train-loads of literature, saturating the land. \
Russia\\nabsorbed reading matter like hot sand drinks water, insatiable. \
And\\nit was not fables, falsified history, diluted religion, and the \
cheap\\nfiction that corrupts--but social and economic theories, \
philosophy,\\nthe works of Tolstoy, Gogol, and Gorky....\\n\\n[4] See Notes \
and Explanations.\\n\\nThen the Talk, beside which Carlyle\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]flood of French speech\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was \
a\\nmere trickle. Lectures, debates, speeches--in theatres, \
circuses,\\nschool-houses, clubs, Soviet meeting-rooms, Union \
headquarters,\\nbarracks.... Meetings in the trenches at the Front, in \
village squares,\\nfactories.... What a marvellous sight to see Putilovsky \
Zavod (the\\nPutilov factory) pour out its forty thousand to listen to Social\
\\nDemocrats, Socialist Revolutionaries, Anarchists, anybody, whatever\\nthey \
had to say, as long as they would talk! For months in Petrograd,\\nand all \
over Russia, every street-corner was a public tribune. In\\nrailway trains, \
street-cars, always the spurting up of impromptu\\ndebate, \
everywhere....\\n\\nAnd the All-Russian Conferences and Congresses, drawing \
together the\\nmen of two continents--conventions of Soviets, of \
Cooperatives,\\nZemstvos,[5] nationalities, priests, peasants, political \
parties; the\\nDemocratic Conference, the Moscow Conference, the Council of \
the\\nRussian Republic. There were always three or four conventions \
going\\non in Petrograd. At every meeting, attempts to limit the time \
of\\nspeakers voted down, and every man free to express the thought \
that\\nwas in him....\\n\\n[5] See Notes and Explanations.\\n\\nWe came down \
to the front of the Twelfth Army, back of Riga, where\\ngaunt and bootless \
men sickened in the mud of desperate trenches; and\\nwhen they saw us they \
started up, with their pinched faces and the\\nflesh showing blue through \
their torn clothing, demanding eagerly,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Did you \
bring anything to _read?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n\\nWhat though the \
outward and visible signs of change were many, what\\nthough the statue of \
Catharine the Great before the Alexandrinsky\\nTheatre bore a little red flag \
in its hand, and others--somewhat\\nfaded--floated from all public buildings; \
and the Imperial monograms\\nand eagles were either torn down or covered up; \
and in place of the\\nfierce _gorodovoye_ (city police) a mild-mannered and \
unarmed citizen\\nmilitia patrolled the streets--still, there were many \
quaint\\nanachronisms.\\n\\nFor example, Peter the Great\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
_Tabel o Rangov--_Table of Ranks--which\\nhe rivetted upon Russia with an \
iron hand, still held sway. Almost\\neverybody from the school-boy up wore \
his prescribed uniform, with\\nthe insignia of the Emperor on button and \
shoulder-strap. Along about\\nfive o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in the afternoon \
the streets were full of subdued old\\ngentlemen in uniform, with portfolios, \
going home from work in the\\nhuge, barrack-like Ministries or Government \
institutions, calculating\\nperhaps how great a mortality among their \
superiors would advance\\nthem to the coveted _tchin_ (rank) of Collegiate \
Assessor, or Privy\\nCouncillor, with the prospect of retirement on a \
comfortable pension,\\nand possibly the Cross of St. Anne....\\n\\nThere is \
the story of Senator Sokolov, who in full tide of Revolution\\ncame to a \
meeting of the Senate one day in civilian clothes, and was\\nnot admitted \
because he did not wear the prescribed livery of \
the\\nTsar\[CloseCurlyQuote]s service!\\n\\nIt was against this background of \
a whole nation in ferment and\\ndisintegration that the pageant of the Rising \
of the Russian Masses\\nunrolled....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter II\\n\\nThe Coming \
Storm\\n\\n\\nIn September General Kornilov marched on Petrograd to make \
himself\\nmilitary dictator of Russia. Behind him was suddenly revealed \
the\\nmailed fist of the bourgeoisie, boldly attempting to crush \
the\\nRevolution. Some of the Socialist Ministers were implicated; \
even\\nKerensky was under suspicion. (See App. II, Sect. 1) \
Savinkov,\\nsummoned to explain to the Central Committee of his party, \
the\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, refused and was expelled. Kornilov \
was\\narrested by the Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees. Generals were \
dismissed,\\nMinisters suspended from their functions, and the Cabinet \
fell.\\n\\nKerensky tried to form a new Government, including the Cadets, \
party\\nof the bourgeoisie. His party, the Socialist \
Revolutionaries,\\nordered him to exclude the Cadets. Kerensky declined to \
obey, and\\nthreatened to resign from the Cabinet if the Socialists insisted.\
\\nHowever, popular feeling ran so high that for the moment he did not\\ndare \
oppose it, and a temporary Directorate of Five of the old\\nMinisters, with \
Kerensky at the head, assumed the power until the\\nquestion should be \
settled.\\n\\nThe Kornilov affair drew together all the Socialist\\ngroups--\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderates\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as well as \
revolutionists--in a passionate impulse\\nof self-defence. There must be no \
more Kornilovs. A new Government\\nmust be created, responsible to the \
elements supporting the\\nRevolution. So the _Tsay-ee-kah_ invited the \
popular organisations\\nto send delegates to a Democratic Conference, which \
should meet at\\nPetrograd in September.\\n\\nIn the _Tsay-ee-kah_ three \
factions immediately appeared. The\\nBolsheviki demanded that the All-Russian \
Congress of Soviets be\\nsummoned, and that they take over the power. The \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]centre\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries, led by Tchernov, joined with the Left \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries, led by Kamkov and Spiridonova, the \
Mensheviki\\nInternationalists under Martov, and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]centre\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Mensheviki,[6]\\nrepresented by Bogdanov and Skobeliev, in demanding a purely\
\\nSocialist Government. Tseretelli, Dan and Lieber, at the head of \
the\\nright wing Mensheviki, and the right Socialist Revolutionaries \
under\\nAvksentiev and Gotz, insisted that the propertied classes must \
be\\nrepresented in the new Government.\\n\\n[6] See Notes and \
Explanations.\\n\\nAlmost immediately the Bolsheviki won a majority in the \
Petrograd\\nSoviet, and the Soviets of Moscow, Kiev, Odessa and other \
cities\\nfollowed suit.\\n\\nAlarmed, the Mensheviki and Socialist \
Revolutionaries in control of\\nthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ decided that after all they \
feared the danger of\\nKornilov less than the danger of Lenin. They revised \
the plan of\\nrepresentation in the Democratic Conference, (See App. II, \
Sect. 2)\\nadmitting more delegates from the Cooperative Societies and \
other\\nconservative bodies. Even this packed assembly at first voted for \
a\\n_Coalition Government without the Cadets._ Only \
Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s open\\nthreat of resignation, and the alarming \
cries of the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nSocialists that \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the Republic is in danger\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
persuaded the\\nConference, by a small majority, to declare in favour of \
the\\nprinciple of coalition with the bourgeoisie, and to sanction \
the\\nestablishment of a sort of consultative Parliament, without \
any\\nlegislative power, called the Provisional Council of the \
Russian\\nRepublic. In the new Ministry the propertied classes \
practically\\ncontrolled, and in the Council of the Russian Republic they \
occupied\\na disproportionate number of seats.\\n\\nThe fact is that the \
_Tsay-ee-kah_ no longer represented the rank\\nand file of the Soviets, and \
had illegally refused to call another\\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, due \
in September. It had no\\nintention of calling this Congress or of allowing \
it to be called.\\nIts official organ, _Izviestia_ (News), began to hint that \
the\\nfunction of the Soviets was nearly at an end, (See App. II, Sect. \
3)\\nand that they might soon be dissolved... At this time, too, the \
new\\nGovernment announced as part of its policy the liquidation of\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]irresponsible \
organisations\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--i.e. the Soviets.\\n\\nThe Bolsheviki \
responded by summoning the All-Russian Soviets to\\nmeet at Petrograd on \
November 2, and take over the Government of\\nRussia. At the same time they \
withdrew from the Council of the\\nRussian Republic, stating that they would \
not participate in a\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Government of Treason to the \
People.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (See App. II, Sect. 4)\\n\\nThe withdrawal of \
the Bolsheviki, however, did not bring\\ntranquillity to the ill-fated \
Council. The propertied classes, now\\nin a position of power, became \
arrogant. The Cadets declared that\\nthe Government had no legal right to \
declare Russia a republic. They\\ndemanded stern measures in the Army and \
Navy to destroy the\\nSoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Sailors\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees, and denounced the Soviets. On \
the\\nother side of the chamber the Mensheviki Internationalists and \
the\\nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries advocated immediate peace, land to\\nthe \
peasants, and workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] control of industry--practically \
the\\nBolshevik programme.\\n\\nI heard Martov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s speech in \
answer to the Cadets. Stooped over the\\ndesk of the tribune like the \
mortally sick man he was, and speaking\\nin a voice so hoarse it could hardly \
be heard, he shook his finger\\ntoward the right benches:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You call us defeatists; but the real defeatists are \
those who wait\\nfor a more propitious moment to conclude peace, insist \
upon\\npostponing peace until later, until nothing is left of the \
Russian\\narmy, until Russia becomes the subject of bargaining between \
the\\ndifferent imperialist groups.... You are trying to impose upon \
the\\nRussian people a policy dictated by the interests of the\\nbourgeoisie. \
The question of peace should be raised without delay....\\nYou will see then \
that not in vain has been the work of those whom\\nyou call German agents, of \
those Zimmerwaldists[7] who in all the\\nlands have prepared the awakening of \
the conscience of the\\ndemocratic \
masses....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n[7] Members of the revoloutionary \
internationalist wing of the\\nSocialists of Europe, so-called because of \
their participation\\nin the International Conference held at Zimmerwald, \
Switzerland,\\nin 1915.\\n\\nBetween these two groups the Mensheviki and \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries wavered, irresistibly forced to the left by \
the\\npressure of the rising dissatisfaction of the masses. Deep \
hostility\\ndivided the chamber into irreconcilable groups.\\n\\nThis was the \
situation when the long-awaited announcement of the\\nAllied Conference in \
Paris brought up the burning question of\\nforeign \
policy....\\n\\nTheoretically all Socialist parties in Russia were in favour \
of the\\nearliest possible peace on democratic terms. As long ago as \
May,\\n1917, the Petrograd Soviet, then under control of the Mensheviki \
and\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, had proclaimed the famous \
Russian\\npeace-conditions. They had demanded that the Allies hold \
a\\nconference to discuss war-aims. This conference had been promised\\nfor \
August; then postponed until September; then until October; and\\nnow it was \
fixed for November 10th.\\n\\nThe Provisional Government suggested two \
representatives--General\\nAlexeyev, reactionary military man, and \
Terestchenko, Minister of\\nForeign Affairs. The Soviets chose Skobeliev to \
speak for them and\\ndrew up a manifesto, the famous _nakaz_--(See App. II, \
Sect. 5)\\ninstructions. The Provisional Government objected to Skobeliev and\
\\nhis _nakaz;_ the Allied ambassadors protested and finally Bonar Law\\nin \
the British House of Commons, in answer to a question, responded\\ncoldly, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As far as I know the Paris Conference will not discuss \
the\\naims of the war at all, but only the methods of conducting it....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt this the conservative Russian press was \
jubilant, and the\\nBolsheviki cried, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See where the \
compromising tactics of the\\nMensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries have \
led them!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAlong a thousand miles of front the \
millions of men in Russia\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\narmies stirred like the sea \
rising, pouring into the capital their\\nhundreds upon hundreds of \
delegations, crying \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Peace! Peace!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nI went across the river to the Cirque Moderne, \
to one of the great\\npopular meetings which occurred all over the city, more \
numerous\\nnight after night. The bare, gloomy amphitheatre, lit by five tiny\
\\nlights hanging from a thin wire, was packed from the ring up the\\nsteep \
sweep of grimy benches to the very roof--soldiers, sailors,\\nworkmen, women, \
all listening as if their lives depended upon it. A\\nsoldier was \
speaking--from the Five Hundred and Forty-eight Division,\\nwherever and \
whatever that was:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried, and there was real anguish in his drawn \
face\\nand despairing gestures. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The people at the top \
are always calling\\nupon us to sacrifice more, sacrifice more, while those \
who have\\neverything are left unmolested.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are \
at war with Germany. Would we invite German generals to\\nserve on our Staff? \
Well we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re at war with the capitalists too, and\\nyet we \
invite them into our Government....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The soldier \
says, \[OpenCurlyQuote]Show me what I am fighting for. Is \
it\\nConstantinople, or is it free Russia? Is it the democracy, or is \
it\\nthe capitalist plunderers? If you can prove to me that I am\\ndefending \
the Revolution then I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll go out and fight without \
capital\\npunishment to force me.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When the land belongs to the peasants, and the \
factories to the\\nworkers, and the power to the Soviets, then we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll know we have\\nsomething to fight for, and we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll fight for it!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the \
barracks, the factories, on the street-corners, end less\\nsoldier speakers, \
all clamouring for an end to the war, declaring\\nthat if the Government did \
not make an energetic effort to get\\npeace, the army would leave the \
trenches and go home.\\n\\nThe spokesman for the Eighth Army:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are weak, we have only a few men left in each \
company. They must\\ngive us food and boots and reinforcements, or soon there \
will be\\nleft only empty trenches. Peace or supplies... either let \
the\\nGovernment end the war or support the \
Army....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFor the Forty-sixth Siberian Artillery:\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The officers will not work with our Committees, \
they betray us to\\nthe enemy, they apply the death penalty to our agitators; \
and the\\ncounter-revolutionary Government supports them. We thought that the\
\\nRevolution would bring peace. But now the Government forbids us even\\nto \
talk of such things, and at the same time doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t give us \
enough\\nfood to live on, or enough ammunition to fight with....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFrom Europe came rumours of peace at the \
expense of Russia. (See\\nApp. II, Sect. 6)...\\n\\nNews of the treatment of \
Russian troops in France added to the\\ndiscontent. The First Brigade had \
tried to replace its officers with\\nSoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees, \
like their comrades at home, and had refused\\nan order to go to Salonika, \
demanding to be sent to Russia. They had\\nbeen surrounded and starved, and \
then fired on by artillery, and\\nmany killed. (See App. II, Sect. \
7)...\\n\\nOn October 29th I went to the white-marble and crimson hall of the\
\\nMarinsky palace, where the Council of the Republic sat, to \
hear\\nTerestchenko\[CloseCurlyQuote]s declaration of the Government\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s foreign policy,\\nawaited with such terrible anxiety by \
all the peace-thirsty and\\nexhausted land.\\n\\nA tall, impeccably-dressed \
young man with a smooth face and high\\ncheek-bones, suavely reading his \
careful, non-committal speech. (See\\nApp. II, Sect. 8) Nothing.... Only the \
same platitudes about crushing\\nGerman militarism with the help of the \
Allies--about the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]state\\ninterests\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of Russia, about the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]embarrassment\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] caused \
by\\nSkobeliev\[CloseCurlyQuote]s _nakaz._ He ended with the key-note:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russia is a great power. Russia will remain a great \
power, whatever\\nhappens. We must all defend her, we must show that we are \
defenders\\nof a great ideal, and children of a great power.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nNobody was satisfied. The reactionaries wanted \
a \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]strong\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nimperialist policy; \
the democratic parties wanted an assurance that\\nthe Government would press \
for peace.... I reproduce an editorial in\\n_Rabotchi i Soldat_ (Worker and \
Soldier), organ of the Bolshevik\\nPetrograd Soviet:\\n\\nTHE GOVERNMENT\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]S ANSWER TO THE TRENCHES\\n\\nThe most taciturn of our \
Ministers, Mr. Terestchenko, has actually\\ntold the trenches the \
following:\\n\\n1. We are closely united with our Allies. (Not with the \
peoples, but\\nwith the Governments.)\\n\\n2. There is no use for the \
democracy to discuss the possibility or\\nimpossibility of a winter campaign. \
That will be decided by the\\nGovernments of our Allies.\\n\\n3. The 1st of \
July offensive was beneficial and a very happy affair.\\n(He did not mention \
the consequences.)\\n\\n4. It is not true that our Allies do not care about \
us. The Minister\\nhas in his possession very important declarations. \
(Declarations?\\nWhat about deeds? What about the behaviour of the British \
fleet?\\n(See App. II, Sect. 9) The parleying of the British king with exiled\
\\ncounter-revolutionary General Gurko? The Minister did not mention\\nall \
this.)\\n\\n5. The _nakaz_ to Skobeliev is bad; the Allies don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like it and the\\nRussian diplomats \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t like it. In the Allied Conference we must\\nall \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]speak one language.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\nAnd is that all? \
That is all. What is the way out? The solution is,\\nfaith in the Allies and \
in Terestchenko. When will peace come? When\\nthe Allies permit.\\n\\nThat is \
how the Government replied to the trenches about peace!\\n\\nNow in the \
background of Russian politics began to form the vague\\noutlines of a \
sinister power--the Cossacks. _Novaya Zhizn_ (New\\nLife), Gorky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paper, called attention to their activities:\\n\\nAt the \
beginning of the Revolution the Cossacks refused to shoot\\ndown the people. \
When Kornilov marched on Petrograd they refused to\\nfollow him. From passive \
loyalty to the Revolution the Cossacks have\\npassed to an active political \
offensive (against it). From the\\nback-ground of the Revolution they have \
suddenly advanced to the\\nfront of the stage....\\n\\nKaledin, _ataman_ of \
the Don Cossacks, had been dismissed by the\\nProvisional Government for his \
complicity in the Kornilov affair. He\\nflatly refused to resign, and \
surrounded by three immense Cossack\\narmies lay at Novotcherkask, plotting \
and menacing. So great was his\\npower that the Government was forced to \
ignore his insubordination.\\nMore than that, it was compelled formally to \
recognise the Council\\nof the Union of Cossack Armies, and to declare \
illegal the\\nnewly-formed Cossack Section of the Soviets....\\n\\nIn the \
first part of October a Cossack delegation called upon\\nKerensky, arrogantly \
insisting that the charges against Kaledin be\\ndropped, and reproaching the \
Minister-President for yielding to the\\nSoviets. Kerensky agreed to let \
Kaledin alone, and then is reported\\nto have said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In \
the eyes of the Soviet leaders I am a despot and a\\ntyrant.... As for the \
Provisional Government, not only does it not\\ndepend upon the Soviets, but \
it considers it regrettable that they\\nexist at all.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\\n\\nAt the same time another Cossack mission called upon the \
British\\nambassador, treating with him boldly as representatives of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the free\\nCossack \
people.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the Don something very like a Cossack \
Republic had been\\nestablished. The Kuban declared itself an independent \
Cossack State.\\nThe Soviets of Rostov-on-Don and Yekaterinburg were \
dispersed by\\narmed Cossacks, and the headquarters of the Coal Miners\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Union at\\nKharkov raided. In all its manifestations the \
Cossack movement was\\nanti-Socialist and militaristic. Its leaders were \
nobles and great\\nland-owners, like Kaledin, Kornilov, Generals Dutov, \
Karaulov and\\nBardizhe, and it was backed by the powerful merchants and \
bankers of\\nMoscow....\\n\\nOld Russia was rapidly breaking up. In Ukraine, \
in Finland, Poland,\\nWhite Russia, the nationalist movements gathered \
strength and became\\nbolder. The local Governments, controlled by the \
propertied classes,\\nclaimed autonomy, refusing to obey orders from \
Petrograd. At\\nHelsingfors the Finnish Senate declined to loan money to \
the\\nProvisional Government, declared Finland autonomous, and demanded\\nthe \
withdrawal of Russian troops. The bourgeois Rada at Kiev\\nextended the \
boundaries of Ukraine until they included all the\\nrichest agricultural \
lands of South Russia, as far east as the\\nUrals, and began the formation of \
a national army. Premier\\nVinnitchenko hinted at a separate peace with \
Germany--and the\\nProvisional Government was helpless. Siberia, the \
Caucasus, demanded\\nseparate Constituent Assemblies. And in all these \
countries there\\nwas the beginning of a bitter struggle between the \
authorities and\\nthe local Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies....\\n\\nConditions were daily more chaotic. \
Hundreds of thousands of\\nsoldiers were deserting the front and beginning to \
move in vast,\\naimless tides over the face of the land. The peasants of \
Tambov and\\nTver Governments, tired of waiting for the land, exasperated by \
the\\nrepressive measures of the Government, were burning manor-houses \
and\\nmassacring land-owners. Immense strikes and lock-outs \
convulsed\\nMoscow, Odessa and the coal-mines of the Don. Transportation \
was\\nparalysed; the army was starving and in the big cities there was \
no\\nbread.\\n\\nThe Government, torn between the democratic and \
reactionary\\nfactions, could do nothing: when forced to act it always \
supported\\nthe interests of the propertied classes. Cossacks were sent \
to\\nrestore order among the peasants, to break the strikes. In \
Tashkent,\\nGovernment authorities suppressed the Soviet. In Petrograd \
the\\nEconomic Council, established to rebuild the shattered economic \
life\\nof the country, came to a deadlock between the opposing forces \
of\\ncapital and labour, and was dissolved by Kerensky. The old \
r\[EAcute]gime\\nmilitary men, backed by Cadets, demanded that harsh measures \
be\\nadopted to restore discipline in the Army and the Navy. In \
vain\\nAdmiral Verderevsky, the venerable Minister of Marine, and \
General\\nVerkhovsky, Minister of War, insisted that only a new, \
voluntary,\\ndemocratic discipline, based on cooperation with the soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nsailors\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees, could save the \
army and navy. Their\\nrecommendations were ignored.\\n\\nThe reactionaries \
seemed determined to provoke popular anger. The\\ntrial of Kornilov was \
coming on. More and more openly the bourgeois\\npress defended him, speaking \
of him as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the great Russian patriot.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nBurtzev\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paper, _Obshtchee \
Dielo_ (Common Cause), called for a\\ndictatorship of Kornilov, Kaledin and \
Kerensky!\\n\\nI had a talk with Burtzev one day in the press gallery of \
the\\nCouncil of the Republic. A small, stooped figure with a \
wrinkled\\nface, eyes near-sighted behind thick glasses, untidy hair and \
beard\\nstreaked with grey.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mark my words, young \
man! What Russia needs is a Strong Man. We\\nshould get our minds off the \
Revolution now and concentrate on the\\nGermans. Bunglers, bunglers, to \
defeat Kornilov; and back of the\\nbunglers are the German agents. Kornilov \
should have won....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the extreme right the \
organs of the scarcely-veiled Monarchists,\\nPurishkevitch\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
_Narodny Tribun_ (People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Tribune), _Novaya Rus_\\n(New \
Russia), and _Zhivoye Slovo_ (Living Word), openly advocated\\nthe \
extermination of the revolutionary democracy....\\n\\nOn the 23rd of October \
occurred the naval battle with a German\\nsquadron in the Gulf of Riga. On \
the pretext that Petrograd was in\\ndanger, the Provisional Government drew \
up plans for evacuating the\\ncapital. First the great munitions works were \
to go, distributed\\nwidely throughout Russia; and then the Government itself \
was to move\\nto Moscow. Instantly the Bolsheviki began to cry out that \
the\\nGovernment was abandoning the Red Capital in order to weaken \
the\\nRevolution. Riga had been sold to the Germans; now Petrograd \
was\\nbeing betrayed!\\n\\nThe bourgeois press was joyful. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At Moscow,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the Cadet \
paper\\n_Ryetch_ (Speech), \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the Government can pursue \
its work in a tranquil\\natmosphere, without being interfered with by \
anarchists.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Rodzianko,\\nleader of the right wing of \
the Cadet party, declared in _Utro\\nRossii_ (The Morning of Russia) that the \
taking of Petrograd by the\\nGermans would be a blessing, because it would \
destroy the Soviets\\nand get rid of the revolutionary Baltic \
Fleet:\\n\\nPetrograd is in danger (he wrote). I say to myself, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let God take\\ncare of Petrograd.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] They fear that if Petrograd is lost the \
central\\nrevolutionary organisations will be destroyed. To that I answer \
that\\nI rejoice if all these organisations are destroyed; for they \
will\\nbring nothing but disaster upon Russia....\\n\\nWith the taking of \
Petrograd the Baltic Fleet will also be\\ndestroyed.... But there will be \
nothing to regret; most of the\\nbattleships are completely \
demoralised....\\n\\nIn the face of a storm of popular disapproval the plan \
of evacuation\\nwas repudiated.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Congress of Soviets loomed \
over Russia like a\\nthunder-cloud, shot through with lightnings. It was \
opposed, not\\nonly by the Government but by all the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists. \
The\\nCentral Army and Fleet Committees, the Central Committees of some \
of\\nthe Trade Unions, the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, but most of \
all the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ itself, spared no pains to prevent the \
meeting.\\n_Izviestia_ and _Golos Soldata_ (Voice of the Soldier), newspapers\
\\nfounded by the Petrograd Soviet but now in the hands of \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ fiercely assailed it, as did the entire artillery \
of\\nthe Socialist Revolutionary party press, _Dielo Naroda_ (People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCause) and _Volia Naroda_ (People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Will).\\n\\nDelegates were sent through the country, messages flashed by wire \
to\\ncommittees in charge of local Soviets, to Army Committees,\\ninstructing \
them to halt or delay elections to the Congress. Solemn\\npublic resolutions \
against the Congress, declarations that the\\ndemocracy was opposed to the \
meeting so near the date of the\\nConstituent Assembly, representatives from \
the Front, from the Union\\nof Zemstvos, the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Union, Union of Cossack Armies, Union of\\nOfficers, Knights of St. George, \
Death Battalions,[8] protesting....\\nThe Council of the Russian Republic was \
one chorus of disapproval.\\nThe entire machinery set up by the Russian \
Revolution of March\\nfunctioned to block the Congress of \
Soviets....\\n\\n[8] See Notes and Explanations.\\n\\nOn the other hand was \
the shapeless will of the proletariat--the\\nworkmen, common soldiers and \
poor peasants. Many local Soviets were\\nalready Bolshevik; then there were \
the organisations of the\\nindustrial workers, the _Fabritchno-Zavodskiye \
Comitieti_--Factory-Shop\\nCommittees; and the insurgent Army and Fleet \
organisations. In some\\nplaces the people, prevented from electing their \
regular Soviet\\ndelegates, held rump meetings and chose one of their number \
to\\ngo to Petrograd. In others they smashed the old \
obstructionist\\ncommittees and formed new ones. A ground-swell of revolt \
heaved\\nand cracked the crust which had been slowly hardening on \
the\\nsurface of revolutionary fires dormant all those months. Only\\nan \
spontaneous mass-movement could bring about the All-Russian\\nCongress of \
Soviets....\\n\\nDay after day the Bolshevik orators toured the barracks \
and\\nfactories, violently denouncing \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]this Government \
of civil war.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] One\\nSunday we went, on a top-heavy \
steam tram that lumbered through\\noceans of mud, between stark factories and \
immense churches, to\\n_Obukhovsky Zavod,_ a Government munitions-plant out \
on the\\nSchl\[UDoubleDot]sselburg Prospekt.\\n\\nThe meeting took place \
between the gaunt brick walls of a huge\\nunfinished building, ten thousand \
black-clothed men and women packed\\naround a scaffolding draped in red, \
people heaped on piles of lumber\\nand bricks, perched high upon shadowy \
girders, intent and\\nthunder-voiced. Through the dull, heavy sky now and \
again burst the\\nsun, flooding reddish light through the skeleton windows \
upon the\\nmass of simple faces upturned to us.\\n\\nLunatcharsky, a slight, \
student-like figure with the sensitive face\\nof an artist, was telling why \
the power must be taken by the\\nSoviets. Nothing else could guarantee the \
Revolution against its\\nenemies, who were deliberately ruining the country, \
ruining the\\narmy, creating opportunities for a new Konilov.\\n\\nA soldier \
from the Rumanian front, thin, tragical and fierce, cried,\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! We are starving at the front, we are stiff \
with cold. We\\nare dying for no reason. I ask the American comrades to carry \
word\\nto America, that the Russians will never give up their \
Revolution\\nuntil they die. We will hold the fort with all our strength \
until\\nthe peoples of the world rise and help us! Tell the American \
workers\\nto rise and fight for the Social \
Revolution!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen came Petrovsky, slight, \
slow-voiced, implacable: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now is the\\ntime for deeds, \
not words. The economic situation is bad, but we\\nmust get used to it. They \
are trying to starve us and freeze us.\\nThey are trying to provoke us. But \
let them know that they can go\\ntoo far--that if they dare to lay their \
hands upon the organisations\\nof the proletariat we will sweep them away \
like scum from the face\\nof the earth!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
Bolshevik press suddenly expanded. Besides the two party papers,\\n_Rabotchi \
Put_ and _Soldat_ (Soldier), there appeared a new paper\\nfor the peasants, \
_Derevenskaya Byednota_ (Village Poorest), poured\\nout in a daily \
half-million edition; and on October 17th, _Rabotchi\\ni Soldat._ Its leading \
article summed up the Bolshevik point of view:\\n\\nThe fourth year\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s campaign will mean the annihilation of the army\\nand the \
country.... There is danger for the safety of \
Petrograd....\\nCounter-revolutionists rejoice in the \
people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s misfortunes.... The\\npeasants brought to \
desperation come out in open rebellion; the\\nlandlords and Government \
authorities massacre them with punitive\\nexpeditions; factories and mines \
are closing down, workmen are\\nthreatened with starvation.... The \
bourgeoisie and its Generals want\\nto restore a blind discipline in the \
army.... Supported by the\\nbourgeoisie, the Kornilovtsi are openly getting \
ready to break up\\nthe meeting of the Constituent Assembly....\\n\\nThe \
Kerensky Government is against the people. He will destroy the\\ncountry.... \
This paper stands for the people and by the people--the\\npoor classes, \
workers, soldiers and peasants. The people can only be\\nsaved by the \
completion of the Revolution... and for this purpose the\\nfull power must be \
in the hands of the Soviets....\\n\\nThis paper advocates the following: All \
power to the Soviets--both in\\nthe capital and in the \
provinces.\\n\\nImmediate truce on all fronts. An honest peace between \
peoples.\\n\\nLandlord estates--without compensation--to the \
peasants.\\n\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] control over industrial \
production.\\n\\nA faithfully and honestly elected Constituent \
Assembly.\\n\\nIt is interesting to reproduce here a passage from that \
same\\npaper--the organ of those Bolsheviki so well known to the world \
as\\nGerman agents:\\n\\nThe German kaiser, covered with the blood of \
millions of dead\\npeople, wants to push his army against Petrograd. Let us \
call to the\\nGerman workmen, soldiers and peasants, who want peace not less \
than\\nwe do, to... stand up against this damned war!\\n\\nThis can be done \
only by a revolutionary Government, which would\\nspeak really for the \
workmen, soldiers and peasants of Russia, and\\nwould appeal over the heads \
of the diplomats directly to the German\\ntroops, fill the German trenches \
with proclamations in the German\\nlanguage.... Our airmen would spread these \
proclamations all over\\nGermany....\\n\\nIn the Council of the Republic the \
gulf between the two sides of the\\nchamber deepened day by day.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The propertied classes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried \
Karelin, for the Left Socialist\\nRevolutionaries, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]want to exploit the revolutionary machine of \
the\\nState to bind Russia to the war-chariot of the Allies! \
The\\nrevolutionary parties are absolutely against this policy....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOld Nicholas Tchaikovsky, representing the \
Populist Socialists,\\nspoke against giving the land to the peasants, and \
took the side of\\nthe Cadets: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must have \
immediately strong discipline in the\\narmy.... Since the beginning of the \
war I have not ceased to insist\\nthat it is a crime to undertake social and \
economic reforms in\\nwar-time. We are committing that crime, and yet I am \
not the enemy\\nof these reforms, because I am a Socialist.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nCries from the Left, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe you!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Mighty applause \
from\\nthe Right....\\n\\nAdzhemov, for the Cadets, declared that there was \
no necessity to\\ntell the army what it was fighting for, since every soldier \
ought to\\nrealise that the first task was to drive the enemy from \
Russian\\nterritory.\\n\\nKerensky himself came twice, to plead passionately \
for national\\nunity, once bursting into tears at the end. The assembly heard \
him\\ncoldly, interrupting with ironical remarks.\\n\\nSmolny Institute, \
headquarters of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and of the\\nPetrograd Soviet, lay miles \
out on the edge of the city, beside the\\nwide Neva. I went there on a \
street-car, moving snail-like with a\\ngroaning noise through the cobbled, \
muddy streets, and jammed with\\npeople. At the end of the line rose the \
graceful smoke-blue cupolas\\nof Smolny Convent outlined in dull gold, \
beautiful; and beside it\\nthe great barracks like fa\[CCedilla]ade of Smolny \
Institute, two hundred\\nyards long and three lofty stories high, the \
Imperial arms carved\\nhugely in stone still insolent over the \
entrance....\\n\\nUnder the old r\[EAcute]gime a famous convent-school for \
the daughters of\\nthe Russian nobility, patronised by the Tsarina herself, \
the\\nInstitute had been taken over by the revolutionary organisations \
of\\nworkers and soldiers. Within were more than a hundred huge \
rooms,\\nwhite and bare, on their doors enamelled plaques still informing the\
\\npasserby that within was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ladies\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Class-room Number 4\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Teachers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nBureau\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; but over these hung crudely-lettered signs, \

\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; and\\nthe central offices and caucus-rooms of the \
political parties....\\n\\nThe long, vaulted corridors, lit by rare electric \
lights, were\\nthronged with hurrying shapes of soldiers and workmen, some \
bent\\nunder the weight of huge bundles of newspapers, \
proclamations,\\nprinted propaganda of all sorts. The sound of their heavy \
boots made\\na deep and incessant thunder on the wooden floor.... Signs were \
posted\\nup everywhere: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! For the sake of your \
health, preserve\\ncleanliness!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Long tables stood at \
the head of the stairs on every\\nfloor, and on the landings, heaped with \
pamphlets and the literature\\nof the different political parties, for \
sale....\\n\\nThe spacious, low-ceilinged refectory downstairs was still \
a\\ndining-room. For two rubles I bought a ticket entitling me to\\ndinner, \
and stood in line with a thousand others, waiting to get to\\nthe long \
serving-tables, where twenty men and women were ladling\\nfrom immense \
cauldrons cabbage soup, hunks of meat and piles of\\n_kasha,_ slabs of black \
bread. Five kopeks paid for tea in a tin\\ncup. From a basket one grabbed a \
greasy wooden spoon.... The benches\\nalong the wooden tables were packed \
with hungry proletarians,\\nwolfing their food, plotting, shouting rough \
jokes across the room....\\n\\n\\n[Graphic, page 33: text of placard in \
russian, translation follows]\\n\\nCOMRADES\\nFOR THE SAKE OF YOUR \
HEALTH,\\nPRESERVE CLEANLINESS.\\n\\nUpstairs was another eating-place, \
reserved for the _Tsay-ee-kah--_\\nthough every one went there. Here could be \
had bread thickly\\nbuttered and endless glasses of tea....\\n\\nIn the south \
wing on the second floor was the great hall of\\nmeetings, the former \
ball-room of the Institute. A lofty white room\\nlighted by glazed-white \
chandeliers holding hundreds of ornate\\nelectric bulbs, and divided by two \
rows of massive columns; at one\\nend a dais, flanked with two tall \
many-branched light standards, and\\na gold frame behind, from which the \
Imperial portrait had been cut.\\nHere on festal occasions had been banked \
brilliant military and\\necclesiastical uniforms, a setting for Grand \
Duchesses....\\n\\nJust across the hall outside was the office of the \
Credentials\\nCommittee for the Congress of Soviets. I stood there watching \
the\\nnew delegates come in--burly, bearded soldiers, workmen in \
black\\nblouses, a few long-haired peasants. The girl in charge--a member \
of\\nPlekhanov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s _Yedinstvo_[9] group--smiled \
contemptuously. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These are\\nvery different people from \
the delegates to the first _Siezd_\\n(Congress),\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she \
remarked. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See how rough and ignorant they look!\\nThe \
Dark People....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It was true; the depths of Russia had \
been\\nstirred, and it was the bottom which came uppermost now. \
The\\nCredentials Committee, appointed by the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ \
was\\nchallenging delegate after delegate, on the ground that they had\\nbeen \
illegally elected. Karakhan, member of the Bolshevik Central\\nCommittee, \
simply grinned. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Never mind,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When the time\\ncomes we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll see \
that you get your seats....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n[9] See Notes and \
Explanations.\\n\\n_Rabotchi i Soldat_ said:\\n\\nThe attention of delegates \
to the new All-Russian Congress is called\\nto attempts of certain members of \
the Organising Committee to break\\nup the Congress, by asserting that it \
will not take place, and that\\ndelegates had better leave Petrograd.... Pay \
no attention to these\\nlies.... Great days are coming....\\n\\nIt was \
evident that a quorum would not come together by November 2,\\nso the opening \
of the Congress was postponed to the 7th. But the\\nwhole country was now \
aroused; and the Mensheviki and Socialist\\nRevolutionaries, realising that \
they were defeated, suddenly changed\\ntheir tactics and began to wire \
frantically to their provincial\\norganisations to elect as many \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist delegates \
as\\npossible. At the same time the Executive Committee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSoviets issued an emergency call for a Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress, to meet\\nDecember 13th and offset whatever \
action the workers and soldiers\\nmight take...\\n\\nWhat would the \
Bolsheviki do? Rumours ran through the city that\\nthere would be an armed \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]demonstration,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] a \
_vystuplennie_--\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]coming\\nout\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
of the workers and soldiers. The bourgeois and reactionary\\npress prophesied \
insurrection, and urged the Government to arrest\\nthe Petrograd Soviet, or \
at least to prevent the meeting of the\\nCongress. Such sheets as _Novaya \
Rus_ advocated a general Bolshevik\\nmassacre.\\n\\nGorky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
paper, _Novaya Zhizn,_ agreed with the Bolsheviki that the\\nreactionaries \
were attempting to destroy the Revolution, and that if\\nnecessary they must \
be resisted by force of arms; but all the\\nparties of the revolutionary \
democracy must present a united front.\\n\\nAs long as the democracy has not \
organised its principal forces, so\\nlong as the resistance to its influence \
is still strong, there is no\\nadvantage in passing to the attack. But if the \
hostile elements\\nappeal to force, then the revolutionary democracy should \
enter the\\nbattle to seize the power, and it will be sustained by the \
most\\nprofound strata of the people....\\n\\nGorky pointed out that both \
reactionary and Government newspapers\\nwere inciting the Bolsheviki to \
violence. An insurrection, however,\\nwould prepare the way for a new \
Kornilov. He urged the Bolsheviki to\\ndeny the rumours. Potressov, in the \
Menshevik _Dien_ (Day),\\npublished a sensational story, accompanied by a \
map, which professed\\nto reveal the secret Bolshevik plan of \
campaign.\\n\\nAs if by magic, the walls were covered with warnings, (See \
App. II,\\nSect. 10) proclamations, appeals, from the Central Committees of \
the\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
conservative factions and the _Tsay-ee-kah,_\\ndenouncing any \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]demonstrations,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] imploring the \
workers and soldiers\\nnot to listen to agitators. For instance, this from \
the Military\\nSection of the Socialist Revolutionary party:\\n\\nAgain \
rumours are spreading around the town of an intended\\n_vystuplennie._ What \
is the source of these rumours? What\\norganisation authorises these \
agitators who preach insurrection? The\\nBolsheviki, to a question addressed \
to them in the _Tsay-ee-kah,_\\ndenied that they have anything to do with \
it.... But these rumours\\nthemselves carry with them a great danger. It may \
easily happen\\nthat, not taking into consideration the state of mind of \
the\\nmajority of the workers, soldiers and peasants, individual \
hot-heads\\nwill call out part of the workers and soldiers on the \
streets,\\ninciting them to an uprising.... In this fearful time through \
which\\nrevolutionary Russia is passing, any insurrection can easily \
turn\\ninto civil war, and there can result from it the destruction of \
all\\norganisations of the proletariat, built up with so much labour.... \
The\\ncounter-revolutionary plotters are planning to take advantage of\\nthis \
insurrection to destroy the Revolution, open the front to\\nWilhelm, and \
wreck the Constituent Assembly.... Stick stubbornly to\\nyour posts! Do not \
come out!\\n\\nOn October 28th, in the corridors of Smolny, I spoke with \
Kameniev,\\na little man with a reddish pointed beard and Gallic gestures. He\
\\nwas not at all sure that enough delegates would come. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If there _is_\\na Congress,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]it will represent the overwhelming \
sentiment\\nof the people. If the majority is Bolshevik, as I think it will \
be,\\nwe shall demand that the power be given to the Soviets, and \
the\\nProvisional Government must \
resign....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nVolodarsky, a tall, pale youth with \
glasses and a bad complexion,\\nwas more definite. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Lieber-Dans\[CloseCurlyQuote] and the other compromisers are\
\\nsabotaging the Congress. If they succeed in preventing \
its\\nmeeting,--well, then we are realists enough not to depend on _that!_\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nUnder date of October 29th I find entered in my \
notebook the\\nfollowing items culled from the newspapers of the \
day:\\n\\nMoghilev (General Staff Headquarters). Concentration here of \
loyal\\nGuard Regiments, the Savage Division, Cossacks and Death \
Battalions.\\n\\nThe _yunkers_ of the Officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Schools of \
Pavlovsk, Tsarskoye Selo\\nand Peterhof ordered by the Government to be ready \
to come to\\nPetrograd. Oranienbaum _yunkers_ arrive in the city.\\n\\nPart \
of the Armoured Car Division of the Petrograd garrism stationed\\nin the \
Winter Palace.\\n\\nUpon orders signed by Trotzky, several thousand rifles \
delivered by\\nthe Government Arms Factory at Sestroretzk to delegates of the\
\\nPetrograd workmen.\\n\\nAt a meeting of the City Militia of the Lower \
Liteiny Quarter, a\\nresolution demanding that all power be given to the \
Soviets.\\n\\nThis is just a sample of the confused events of those feverish \
days,\\nwhen everybody knew that something was going to happen, but \
nobody\\nknew just what.\\n\\nAt a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet in Smolny, \
the night of October\\n30th, Trotzky branded the assertions of the bourgeois \
press that the\\nSoviet contemplated armed insurention as \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]an attempt of the\\nreactionaries to discredit and \
wreck the Congress of Soviets.... The\\nPetrograd Soviet,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he declared, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]had not ordered \
any _uystuplennie._\\nIf it is necessary we shall do so, and we will be \
supported by the\\nPetrogruad garrison.... They (the Government) are \
preparing a\\ncounter-revolution; and we shall answer with an offensive which \
will\\nbe merciless and decisive.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIt is true \
that the Petrograd Soviet had not ordered a\\ndemonstration, but the Central \
Committee of the Bolshevik party was\\nconsidering the question of \
insurrection. All night long the 23d\\nthey met. There were present all the \
party intellectuals, the\\nleaders--and delegates of the Petrograd workers \
and garrison. Alone\\nof the intellectuals Lenin and Trotzky stood for \
insurrection. Even\\nthe military men opposed it. A vote was taken. \
Insurrection was\\ndefeated!\\n\\nThen arose a rough workman, his face \
convulsed with rage. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I speak\\nfor the Petrograd \
proletariat,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, harshly. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are in\\nfavour of insurrection. Have it your own \
way, but I tell you now\\nthat if you allow the Soviets to be destroyed, _we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re through with\\nyou!_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Some \
soldiers joined him.... And after that they voted\\nagain--insurrection \
won....\\n\\nHowever, the right wing of the Bolsheviki, led by Riazanov, \
Kameniev\\nand Zinoviev, continued to campaign against an armed rising. On \
the\\nmorning of October 31st appeared in _Rabotchi Put_ the \
first\\ninstalment of Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Letter \
to the Comrades,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (See App. II, Sect.\\n11) one of the \
most audacious pieces of political propaganda the\\nworld has ever seen. In \
it Lenin seriously presented the arguments\\nin favour of insurrection, \
taking as text the objections of Kameniev\\nand Riazonov.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Either we must abandon our slogan, \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]All Power to the Soviets,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nwrote, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]or else we must \
make an insurrection. There is no middle\\ncourse....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\\n\\nThat same afternoon Paul Miliukov, leader of the Cadets, made \
a\\nbrilliant, bitter speech (See App. II, Sect. 12) in the Council of\\nthe \
Republic, branding the Skobeliev _nakaz_ as pro-German,\\ndeclaring that the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]revolutionary democracy\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was \
destroying Russia,\\nsneering at Terestchenko, and openly declaring that he \
preferred\\nGerman diplomacy to Russian.... The Left benches were one roaring\
\\ntumult all through....\\n\\nOn its part the Government could not ignore \
the significance of the\\nsuccess of the Bolshevik propaganda. On the 29th \
joint commission of\\nthe Government and the Council of the Republic hastily \
drew up two\\nlaws, one for giving the land temporarily to the peasants, and \
the\\nother for pushing an energetic foreign policy of peace. The next \
day\\nKerensky suspended capital punishment in the army. That \
same\\nafternoon was opened with great ceremony the first session of \
the\\nnew \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Commission for Strengthening the Republican \
R\[EAcute]gime and Fighting\\nAgainst Anarchy and Counter-Revolution\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--of which history shows not\\nthe slightest further \
trace.... The following morning with two other\\ncorrespondents I interviewed \
Kerensky (See App. II, Sect. 13)--the\\nlast time he received journalists.\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Russian people,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
said, bitterly, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]are suffering from\\neconomic \
fatigue--and from disillusionment with the Allies! The world\\nthinks that \
the Russian Revolution is at an end. Do not be mistaken.\\nThe Russian \
Revolution is just beginning....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Words more \
prophetic,\\nperhaps, than he knew.\\n\\nStormy was the all-night meeting of \
the Petrograd Soviet the 30th of\\nOctober, at which I was present. The \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Socialist\\nintellectuals, officers, members of Army Committees, \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ were there in force. Against them rose up \
workmen,\\npeasants and common soldiers, passionate and simple.\\n\\nA \
peasant told of the disorders in Tver, which he said were caused\\nby the \
arrest of the Land Committees. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This Kerensky is \
nothing but\\na shield to the _pomieshtchiki_ (landowners),\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They know\\nthat at \
the Constituent Assembly we will take the land anyway, so\\nthey are trying \
to destroy the Constituent Assembly!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA machinist \
from the Putilov works described how the superintendents\\nwere closing down \
the departments one by one on the pretext that\\nthere was no fuel or raw \
materials. The Factory-Shop Committee, he\\ndeclared, had discovered huge \
hidden supplies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is a _provocatzia,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ said he. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They want to starve \
us--or drive\\nus to violence!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAmong the \
soldiers one began, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! I bring you greetings \
from\\nthe place where men are digging their graves and call them trenches!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen arose a tall, gaunt young soldier, with \
flashing eyes, met with\\na roar of welcome. It was Tchudnovsky, reported \
killed in the July\\nfighting, and now risen from the dead.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The soldier masses no longer trust their officers. \
Even the Army\\nCommittees, who refused to call a meeting of our Soviet, \
betrayed\\nus.... The masses of the soldiers want the Constituent Assembly to \
be\\nheld exactly when it was called for, and those who dare to postpone\\nit \
will be cursed--and not only platonic curses either, for the Army\\nhas guns \
too....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe told of the electoral campaign for \
the Constituent now raging in\\nthe Fifth Army. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
officers, and especially the Mensheviki and the\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, \
are trying deliberately to cripple the\\nBolsheviki. Our papers are not \
allowed to circulate in the trenches.\\nOur speakers are arrested--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you speak about the lack of bread?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shouted another\\nsoldier.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Man shall not live by bread alone,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered Tchudnovsky, sternly....\\n\\nFollowed him \
an officer, delegate from the Vitebsk Soviet, a\\nMenshevik _oboronetz._ \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the question of who has the \
power.\\nThe trouble is not with the Government, but with the war.... and the\
\\nwar must be won before any change--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At this, hoots \
and ironical\\ncheers. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These Bolshevik agitators are \
demagogues!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The hall rocked\\nwith laughter. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let us for a moment forget the class struggle--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] But\\nhe got no farther. A voice yelled, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you wish we would!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nPetrograd presented a curious spectacle in \
those days. In the\\nfactories the committee-rooms were filled with stacks of \
rifles,\\ncouriers came and went, the Red Guard[10] drilled.... In all \
the\\nbarracks meetings every night, and all day long interminable \
hot\\narguments. On the streets the crowds thickened toward gloomy\\nevening, \
pouring in slow voluble tides up and down the Nevsky,\\nfighting for the \
newspapers.... Hold-ups increased to such an extent\\nthat it was dangerous \
to walk down side streets.... On the Sadovaya\\none afternoon I saw a crowd \
of several hundred people beat and\\ntrample to death a soldier caught \
stealing.... Mysterious individuals\\ncirculated around the shivering women \
who waited in _queue_ long\\ncold hours for bread and milk, whispering that \
the Jews had cornered\\nthe food supply--and that while the people starved, \
the Soviet\\nmembers lived luxuriously....\\n\\n[10] See Notes and \
Explanations.\\n\\nAt Smolny there were strict guards at the door and the \
outer gates,\\ndemanding everybody\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pass. The \
committee-rooms buzzed and hummed\\nall day and all night, hundreds of \
soldiers and workmen slept on the\\nfloor, wherever they could find room. \
Upstairs in the great hall a\\nthousand people crowded to the uproarious \
sessions of the Petrograd\\nSoviet....\\n\\nGambling clubs functioned \
hectically from dusk to dawn, with\\nchampagne flowing and stakes of twenty \
thousand rubles. In the\\ncentre of the city at night prostitutes in jewels \
and expensive furs\\nwalked up and down, crowded the \
caf\[EAcute]s....\\n\\nMonarchist plots, German spies, smugglers hatching \
schemes....\\n\\nAnd in the rain, the bitter chill, the great throbbing city \
under\\ngrey skies rushing faster and faster \
toward--what?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter III\\n\\nOn the Eve\\n\\n\\nIn the \
relations of a weak Government and a rebellious people there\\ncomes a time \
when every act of the authorities exasperates the\\nmasses, and every refusal \
to act excites their contempt....\\n\\nThe proposal to abandon Petrograd \
raised a hurricane; Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\npublic denial that the \
Government had any such intention was met with\\nhoots of \
derision.\\n\\nPinned to the wall by the pressure of the Revolution (cried \
_Rabotchi\\nPut),_ the Government of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]provisional\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] bourgeois tries to get free by\\ngiving out lying \
assurances that it never thought of fleeing from\\nPetrograd, and that it \
didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t wish to surrender the capital....\\n\\nIn Kharkov \
thirty thousand coal miners organised, adopting the\\npreamble of the I. W. \
W. constitution: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The working class and the\\nemploying \
class have nothing in common.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Dispersed by Cossacks, \
some\\nwere locked out by the mine-owners, and the rest declared a \
general\\nstrike. Minister of Commerce and Industry Konovalov appointed \
his\\nassistant, Orlov, with plenary powers, to settle the trouble. \
Orlov\\nwas hated by the miners. But the _Tsay-ee-kah_ not only supported his\
\\nappointment, but refused to demand that the Cossacks be recalled \
from\\nthe Don Basin....\\n\\nThis was followed by the dispersal of the \
Soviet at Kaluga. The\\nBolsheviki, having secured a majority in the Soviet, \
set free some\\npolitical prisoners. With the sanction of the Government \
Commissar\\nthe Municipal Duma called in troops from Minsk, and bombarded the\
\\nSoviet headquarters with artillery. The Bolsheviki yielded, but as\\nthey \
left the building Cossacks attacked them, crying, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This \
is what\\nwe\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll do to all the other Bolshevik Soviets, \
including those of\\nMoscow and Petrograd!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] This \
incident sent a wave of panic rage\\nthroughout Russia....\\n\\nIn Petrograd \
was ending a regional Congress of Soviets of the North,\\npresided over by \
the Bolshevik Krylenko. By an immense majority it\\nresolved that all power \
should be assumed by the All-Russian\\nCongress; and concluded by greeting \
the Bolsheviki in prison, bidding\\nthem rejoice, for the hour of their \
liberation was at hand. At the\\nsame time the first All-Russian Conference \
of Factory-Shop Committees\\n(See App. III, Sect. 1) declared emphatically \
for the Soviets, and\\ncontinued significantly,\\n\\nAfter liberating \
themselves politically from Tsardom, the\\nworking-class wants to see the \
democratic r\[EAcute]gime triumphant in the\\nsphere of its productive \
activity. This is best expressed by Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nControl over \
industrial production, which naturally arose in the\\natmosphere of economic \
decomposition created by the criminal policy\\nof the dominating \
classes....\\n\\nThe Union of Railwaymen was demanding the resignation of \
Liverovsky,\\nMinister of Ways and Communications....\\n\\nIn the name of the \
_Tsay-ee-kah,_ Skobeliev insisted that the _nakaz_\\nbe presented at the \
Allied Conference, and formally protested against\\nthe sending of \
Terestchenko to Paris. Terestchenko offered to resign....\\n\\nGeneral \
Verkhovsky, unable to accomplish his reorganisation of the\\narmy, only came \
to Cabinet meetings at long intervals....\\n\\nOn November 3d Burtzev\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s _Obshtchee Dielo_ came out with \
great\\nheadlines:\\n\\nCitizens! Save the fatherland!\\n\\nI have just \
learned that yesterday, at a meeting of the Commission\\nfor National \
Defence, Minister of War General Verkhovsky, one of the\\nprincipal persons \
responsible for the fall of Kornilov, proposed to\\nsign a separate peace, \
independently of the Allies.\\n\\nThat is treason to \
Russia!\\n\\nTerestchenko declared that the Provisional Government had not \
even\\nexamined Verkhovsky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proposition.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You might think,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said \
Terestchenko, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that we were in a madhouse!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe members of the Commission were astounded at \
the General\[CloseCurlyQuote]s words.\\n\\nGeneral Alexeyev wept.\\n\\nNo! It \
is not madness! It is worse. It is direct treason to Russia!\\n\\nKerensky, \
Terestchenko and Nekrassov must immediately answer us\\nconcerning the words \
of Verkhovsky.\\n\\nCitizens, arise!\\n\\nRussia is being sold!\\n\\nSave \
her!\\n\\nWhat Verkhovsky really said was that the Allies must be pressed \
to\\noffer peace, because the Russian army could fight no \
longer....\\n\\nBoth in Russia and abroad the sensation was tremendous. \
Verkhovsky\\nwas given \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]indefinite leave of absence for \
ill-health,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and left the\\nGovernment. _Obshtchee \
Dielo_ was suppressed....\\n\\nSunday, November 4th, was designated as the \
Day of the Petrograd\\nSoviet, with immense meetings planned all over the \
city, ostensibly\\nto raise money for the organisation and the press; really, \
to make a\\ndemonstration of strength. Suddenly it was announced that on the \
same\\nday the Cossacks would hold a _Krestny Khod_--Procession of \
the\\nCross--in honour of the Ikon of 1612, through whose \
miraculous\\nintervention Napoleon had been driven from Moscow. The \
atmosphere was\\nelectric; a spark might kindle civil war. The Petrograd \
Soviet issued\\na manifesto, headed \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Brothers--Cossacks!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nYou, \
Cossacks, are being incited against us, workers and soldiers.\\nThis plan of \
Cain is being put into operation by our common enemies,\\nthe oppressors, the \
privileged classes--generals, bankers, landlords,\\nformer officials, former \
servants of the Tsar.... We are hated by all\\ngrafters, rich men, princes, \
nobles, generals, including your Cossack\\ngenerals. They are ready at any \
moment to destroy the Petrograd\\nSoviet and crush the Revolution....\\n\\nOn \
the 4th of November somebody is organising a Cossack religious\\nprocession. \
It is a question of the free consciousness of every\\nindividual whether he \
will or will not take part in this procession.\\nWe do not interfere in this \
matter, nor do we obstruct anybody....\\nHowever, we warn you, Cossacks! Look \
out and see to it that under the\\npretext of a _Krestni Khod,_ your Kaledins \
do not instigate you\\nagainst workmen, against soldiers....\\n\\nThe \
procession was hastily called off....\\n\\nIn the barracks and the \
working-class quarters of the town the\\nBolsheviki were preaching, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All Power to the Soviets!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
agents of\\nthe Dark Forces were urging the people to rise and slaughter \
the\\nJews, shop-keepers, Socialist leaders....\\n\\nOn one side the \
Monarchist press, inciting to bloody repression--on\\nthe other Lenin\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s great voice roaring, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Insurrection!.... We cannot\\nwait any longer!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nEven the bourgeois press was uneasy. (See App. \
III, Sect. 2)\\n_Birjevya Viedomosti_ (Exchange Gazette) called the Bolshevik\
\\npropaganda an attack on \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the most elementary \
principles of\\nsociety--personal security and the respect for private \
property.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n[Graphic, page 46: Appeal of the \

\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] it begins. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Petrograd \
Soviet of\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies \
addresses you.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBut it was the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist journals \
which were the most\\nhostile. (See App. III, Sect. 3) \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolsheviki are the most\\ndangerous enemies of the \
Revolution,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] declared _Dielo Naroda._ Said\\nthe \
Menshevik _Dien,_ \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government ought to defend \
itself and\\ndefend us.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Plekhanov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
paper, _Yedinstvo_ (Unity) (See App. III,\\nSect. 4), called the attention of \
the Government to the fact that the\\nPetrograd workers were being armed, and \
demanded stern measures\\nagainst the Bolsheviki.\\n\\nDaily the Government \
seemed to become more helpless. Even the\\nMunicipal administration broke \
down. The columns of the morning\\npapers were filled with accounts of the \
most audacious robberies and\\nmurders, and the criminals were unmolested.\\n\
\\nOn the other hand armed workers patrolled the streets at night, \
doing\\nbattle with marauders and requisitioning arms wherever they \
found\\nthem.\\n\\nOn the first of November Colonel Polkovnikov, Military \
Commander of\\nPetrograd, issued a proclamation:\\n\\nDespite the difficult \
days through which the country is passing,\\nirresponsible appeals to armed \
demonstrations and massacres are still\\nbeing spread around Petrograd, and \
from day to day robbery and\\ndisorder increase.\\n\\nThis state of things is \
disorganising the life of the citizens, and\\nhinders the systematic work of \
the Government and the Municipal\\nInstitutions.\\n\\nIn full consciousness \
of my responsibility and my duty before my\\ncountry, I command:\\n\\n1. \
Every military unit, in accordance with special instructions and\\nwithin the \

to the Commissars, and to the militia, in the\\nguarding of Government \
institutions.\\n\\n2. The organisation of patrols, in co-operation with the \
District\\nCommander and the representatives of the city militia, and the \
taking\\nof measures for the arrest of criminals and deserters.\\n\\n3. The \
arrest of all persons entering barracks and inciting to \
armed\\ndemonstrations and massacres, and their delivery to the \

\\n5. To afford assistance to the Commissars in preventing \
unwarranted\\nsearches in houses and unwarranted arrests.\\n\\n6. To report \
immediately all that happens in the district under\\ncharge to the Staff of \
the Petrograd Military District.\\n\\nI call upon all Army Committees and \
organisations to afford their\\nhelp to the commanders in fulfilment of the \
duties with which they\\nare charged.\\n\\nIn the Council of the Republic \
Kerensky declared that the Government\\nwas fully aware of the Bolshevik \
preparations, and had sufficient\\nforce to cope with any demonstration. (See \
App. III, Sect. 5) He\\naccused _Novaya Rus_ and _Robotchi Put_ of both doing \
the same kind\\nof subversive work. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But owing to the \
absolute freedom of the press,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nhe added, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the Government is not in a position to combat \
printed\\nlies.[11]....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Declaring that these were two \
aspects of the same\\npropaganda, which had for its object the \
counter-revolution, so\\nardently desired by the Dark Forces, he went \
on:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am a doomed man, it \
doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t matter what happens to me, and I have\\nthe audacity \
to say that the other enigmatic part is that of the\\nunbelievable \
provocation created in the city by the Bolsheviki!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\n[11] This was not quite candid. The Provisional Government \
had\\nsuppressed Bolshevik papers before, in July, and was planning to\\ndo \
so again.\\n\\nOn November 2d only fifteen delegates to the Congress of \
Soviets had\\narrived. Next day there were a hundred, and the morning after \
that a\\nhundred and seventy-five, of whom one hundred and three \
were\\nBolsheviki.... Four hundred constituted a quorum, and the Congress was\
\\nonly three days off....\\n\\nI spent a great deal of time at Smolny. It \
was no longer easy to get\\nin. Double rows of sentries guarded the outer \
gates, and once inside\\nthe front door there was a long line of people \
waiting to be let in,\\nfour at a time, to be questioned as to their identity \
and their\\nbusiness. Passes were given out, and the pass system was \
changed\\nevery few hours; for spies continually sneaked \
through....\\n\\n[Graphic, page 49: Russian Pass to Reed, translation \

\\n                               Adjutant\\n\\nOne day as I came up to the \
outer gate I saw Trotzky and his wife\\njust ahead of me. They were halted by \
a soldier. Trotzky searched\\nthrough his pockets, but could find no pass.\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Never mind,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said \
finally. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You know me. My name is Trotzky.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You haven\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t got a pass,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the soldier \
stubbornly.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You cannot go in. Names don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mean anything to me.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But I am the president of the Petrograd Soviet.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] replied the soldier, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]if you\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re as important a fellow as that\\nyou must at least have \
one little paper.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTrotzky was very patient. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let me see the Commandant,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
said. The\\nsoldier hesitated, grumbling something about not wanting to \
disturb\\nthe Commandant for every devil that came along. He beckoned finally\
\\nto the soldier in command of the guard. Trotzky explained matters \
to\\nhim. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]My name is Trotzky,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he repeated.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Trotzky?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The \
other soldier scratched his head. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve heard the name\\nsomewhere,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said at length. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I guess it\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all right. You can go on\\nin, comrade....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the corridor I met Karakhan, member of the \
Bolshevik Central\\nCommittee, who explained to me what the new Government \
would be like.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A loose organisation, sensitive to \
the popular will as expressed\\nthrough the Soviets, allowing local forces \
full play. At present the\\nProvisional Government obstructs the action of \
the local democratic\\nwill, just as the Tsar\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Government \
did. The initiative of the new\\nsociety shall come from below.... The form \
of the Government will be\\nmodelled on the Constitution of the Russian \
Social Democratic Labour\\nParty. The new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ responsible to \
frequent meetings of the\\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets, will be the \
parliament; the various\\nMinistries will be headed by \
_collegia_--committees--instead of by\\nMinisters, and will be directly \
responsible to the Soviets....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn October 30th, \
by appointment, I went up to a small, bare room in\\nthe attic of Smolny, to \
talk with Trotzky. In the middle of the room\\nhe sat on a rough chair at a \
bare table. Few questions from me were\\nnecessary; he talked rapidly and \
steadily, for more than an hour. The\\nsubstance of his talk, in his own \
words, I give here:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Provisional Government is \
absolutely powerless. The bourgeoisie\\nis in control, but this control is \
masked by a fictitious coalition\\nwith the _oborontsi_ parties. Now, during \
the Revolution, one sees\\nrevolts of peasants who are tired of waiting for \
their promised land;\\nand all over the country, in all the toiling classes, \
the same\\ndisgust is evident. This domination by the bourgeoisie is \
only\\npossible by means of civil war. The Kornilov method is the only \
way\\nby which the bourgeoisie can control. But it is force which \
the\\nbourgeoisie lacks.... The Army is with us. The conciliators \
and\\npacifists, Socialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki, have lost \
all\\nauthority--because the struggle between the peasants and \
the\\nlandlords, between the workers and the employers, between \
the\\nsoldiers and the officers, has become more bitter, \
more\\nirreconcilable than ever. Only by the concerted action of the \
popular\\nmass, only by the victory of proletarian dictatorship, can \
the\\nRevolution be achieved and the people saved....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Soviets are the most perfect representatives of \
the\\npeople--perfect in their revolutionary experience, in their ideas \
and\\nobjects. Based directly upon the army in the trenches, the workers \
in\\nthe factories, and the peasants in the fields, they are the \
backbone\\nof the Revolution.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There has been an \
attempt to create a power without the Soviets--and\\nonly powerlessness has \
been created. Counter-revolutionary schemes of\\nall sorts are now being \
hatched in the corridors of the Council of the\\nRussian Republic. The Cadet \
party represents the counter-revolution\\nmilitant. On the other side, the \
Soviets represent the cause of\\nthe people. Between the two camps there are \
no groups of serious\\nimportance.... It is the _lutte finale._ The bourgeois \
counter-revolution\\norganises all its forces and waits for the moment to \
attack us. Our\\nanswer will be decisive. We will complete the work scarcely \
begun in\\nMarch, and advanced during the Kornilov affair....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe went on to speak of the new Government\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s foreign policy:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our first act \
will be to call for an immediate armistice on all\\nfronts, and a conference \
of peoples to discuss democratic peace\\nterms. The quantity of democracy we \
get in the peace settlement\\ndepends on the quantity of revolutionary \
response there is in Europe.\\nIf we create here a Government of the Soviets, \
that will be a\\npowerful factor for immediate peace in Europe; for this \
Government\\nwill address itself directly and immediately to all peoples, \
over the\\nheads of their Governments, proposing an armistice. At the moment \
of\\nthe conclusion of peace the pressure of the Russian Revolution will\\nbe \
in the direction of \[OpenCurlyQuote]no annexations, no indemnities, the \
right of\\nself-determination of peoples,\[CloseCurlyQuote] and a _Federated \
Republic of Europe._...\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At the end of this war I \
see Europe recreated, not by the diplomats,\\nbut by the proletariat. The \
Federated Republic of Europe--the United\\nStates of Europe--that is what \
must be. National autonomy no longer\\nsuffices. Economic evolution demands \
the abolition of national\\nfrontiers. If Europe is to remain split into \
national groups, then\\nImperialism will recommence its work. Only a \
Federated Republic of\\nEurope can give peace to the world.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He smiled--that fine, faintly\\nironical smile of \
his. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But without the action of the European\\nmasses, \
these ends cannot be realised--now....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nNow while \
everybody was waiting for the Bolsheviki to appear suddenly\\non the streets \
one morning and begin to shoot down people with white\\ncollars on, the real \
insurrection took its way quite naturally and\\nopenly.\\n\\nThe Provisional \
Government planned to send the Petrograd garrison to\\nthe front.\\n\\nThe \
Petrograd garrison numbered about sixty thousand men, who had\\ntaken a \
prominent part in the Revolution. It was they who had turned\\nthe tide in \
the great days of March, created the Soviets of \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies, and hurled back Kornilov from the \
gates of Petrograd.\\n\\nNow a large part of them were Bolsheviki. When the \
Provisional\\nGovernment talked of evacuating the city, it was the \
Petrograd\\ngarrison which answered, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If you are not \
capable of defending the\\ncapital, conclude peace; if you cannot conclude \
peace, go away and\\nmake room for a People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Government \
which can do both....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIt was evident that any \
attempt at insurrection depended upon the\\nattitude of the Petrograd \
garrison. The Government\[CloseCurlyQuote]s plan was to\\nreplace the \
garrison regiments with \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]dependable\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] troops--Cossacks,\\nDeath Battalions. The Army \
Committees, the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Socialists and\\nthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ supported the Government. A wide-spread \
agitation\\nwas carried on at the Front and in Petrograd, emphasizing the \
fact\\nthat for eight months the Petrograd garrison had been leading an \
easy\\nlife in the barracks of the capital, while their exhausted \
comrades\\nin the trenches starved and died.\\n\\nNaturally there was some \
truth in the accusation that the garrison\\nregiments were reluctant to \
exchange their comparative comfort for\\nthe hardships of a winter campaign. \
But there were other reasons why\\nthey refused to go. The Petrograd Soviet \
feared the Government\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nintentions, and from the Front \
came hundreds of delegates, chosen by\\nthe common soldiers, crying, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is true we need reinforcements, but\\nmore \
important, we must know that Petrograd and the Revolution \
are\\nwell-guarded.... Do you hold the rear, comrades, and we will hold \
the\\nfront!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn October 25th, behind closed \
doors, the Central Committee of the\\nPetrograd Soviet discussed the \
formation of a special Military\\nCommittee to decide the whole question. The \
next day a meeting of the\\nSoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Section of the \
Petrograd Soviet elected a Committee, which\\nimmediately proclaimed a \
boycott of the bourgeois newspapers, and\\ncondemned the _Tsay-ee-kah_ for \
opposing the Congress of Soviets. On\\nthe 29th, in open session of the \
Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky proposed\\nthat the Soviet formally sanction the \
Military Revolutionary\\nCommittee. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We ought,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to create our \
special organisation\\nto march to battle, and if necessary to die....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It was decided to send\\nto the front two \
delegations, one from the Soviet and one from the\\ngarrison, to confer with \
the Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees and the General\\nStaff.\\n\\nAt \
Pskov, the Soviet delegates were met by General Tcheremissov,\\ncommander of \
the Northern Front, with the curt declaration that he\\nhad ordered the \
Petrograd garrison to the trenches, and that was all.\\nThe garrison \
committee was not allowed to leave Petrograd....\\n\\nA delegation of the \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Section of the Petrograd Soviet asked\\nthat a \
representative be admitted to the Staff of the Petrograd\\nDistrict. Refused. \
The Petrograd Soviet demanded that no orders be\\nissued without the approval \
of the Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Section. Refused. The\\ndelegates were \
roughly told, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We only recognise the _Tsay-ee-kah._ \
We\\ndo not recognise you; if you break any laws, we shall arrest you.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the 30th a meeting of representatives of all \
the Petrograd\\nregiments passed a resolution: _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
Petrograd garrison no longer\\nrecognises the Provisional Government. The \
Petrograd Soviet is our\\nGovernment. We will obey only the orders of the \
Petrograd Soviet,\\nthrough the Military Revolutionary Committee.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ The local military\\nunits were ordered to wait for \
instructions from the Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSection of the Petrograd \
Soviet.\\n\\nNext day the _Tsay-ee-kah_ summoned its own meeting, composed \
largely\\nof officers, formed a Committee to cooperate with the Staff, \
and\\ndetailed Commissars in all quarters of the city.\\n\\nA great soldier \
meeting at Smolny on the 3d resolved:\\n\\nSaluting the creation of the \
Military Revolutionary Committee, the\\nPetrograd garrison promises it \
complete support in all its actions,\\nto unite more closely the front and \
the rear in the interests of the\\nRevolution.\\n\\nThe garrison moreover \
declares that with the revolutionary\\nproletariat it assures the maintenance \
of revolutionary order in\\nPetrograd. Every attempt at provocation on the \
part of the\\nKornilovtsi or the bourgeoisie will be met with merciless \
resistance.\\n\\nNow conscious of its power, the Military Revolutionary \
Committee\\nperemptorily summoned the Petrograd Staff to submit to its \
control.\\nTo all printing plants it gave orders not to publish any appeals \
or\\nproclamations without the Committee\[CloseCurlyQuote]s authorisation. \
Armed Commissars\\nvisited the Kronversk arsenal and seized great quantities \
of arms and\\nammunition, halting a shipment of ten thousand bayonets which \
was\\nbeing sent to Novotcherkask, headquarters of Kaledin....\\n\\nSuddenly \
awake to the danger, the Government offered immunity if the\\nCommittee would \
disband. Too late. At midnight November 5th Kerensky\\nhimself sent Malevsky \
to offer the Petrograd Soviet representation on\\nthe Staff. The Military \
Revolutionary Committee accepted. An hour\\nlater General Manikovsky, acting \
Minister of war, countermanded the\\noffer....\\n\\nTuesday morning, November \
6th, the city was thrown into excitement by\\nthe appearance of a placard \
signed, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Military Revolutionary Committee\\nattached to \
the Petrograd Soviet of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTo the Population \
of Petrograd. Citizens!\\n\\nCounter-revolution has raised its criminal head. \
The Kornilovtsi are\\nmobilising their forces in order to crush the \
All-Russian Congress of\\nSoviets and break the Constituent Assembly. At the \
same time the\\n_pogromists_ may attempt to call upon the people of Petrograd \
for\\ntrouble and bloodshed. The Petrograd Soviet of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies takes \
upon itself the guarding of revolutionary order in the\\ncity against \
counter-revolutionary and _pogrom_ attempts.\\n\\nThe Petrograd garrison will \
not allow any violence or disorders. The\\npopulation is invited to arrest \
hooligans and Black Hundred agitators\\nand take them to the Soviet \
Commissars at the nearest barracks. At\\nthe first attempt of the Dark Forces \
to make trouble on the streets\\nof Petrograd, whether robbery or fighting, \
the criminals will be\\nwiped off the face of the earth!\\n\\nCitizens! We \
call upon you to maintain complete quiet and\\nself-possession. The cause of \
order and Revolution is in strong hands.\\n\\nList of regiments where there \
are Commissars of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee....\\n\\nOn the 3rd \
the leaders of the Bolsheviki had another historic meeting\\nbehind closed \
doors. Notified by Zalkind, I waited in the corridor\\noutside the door; and \
Volodarsky as he came out told me what was\\ngoing on.\\n\\nLenin spoke: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]November 6th will be too early. We must have \
an\\nall-Russian basis for the rising; and on the 6th all the delegates \
to\\nthe Congress will not have arrived.... On the other hand, November \
8th\\nwill be too late. By that time the Congress will be organised, and \
it\\nis difficult for a large organised body of people to take \
swift,\\ndecisive action. We must act on the 7th, the day the Congress meets,\
\\nso that we may say to it, \[OpenCurlyQuote]Here is the power! What are you \
going to\\ndo with it?\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn a \
certain upstairs room sat a thin-faced, long-haired individual,\\nonce an \
officer in the armies of the Tsar, then revolutionist and\\nexile, a certain \
Avseenko, called Antonov, mathematician and\\nchess-player; he was drawing \
careful plans for the seizure of the\\ncapital.\\n\\nOn its side the \
Government was preparing. Inconspicuously certain of\\nthe most loyal \
regiments, from widely-separated divisions, were\\nordered to Petrograd. The \
_yunker_ artillery was drawn into the\\nWinter Palace. Patrols of Cossacks \
made their appearance in the\\nstreets, for the first time since the July \
days. Polkovnikov issued\\norder after order, threatening to repress all \
insubordination with\\nthe \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]utmost energy.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Kishkin, Minister of Public Instruction, \
the\\nworst-hated member of the Cabinet, was appointed Special Commissar \
to\\nkeep order in Petrograd; he named as assistants two men no \
less\\nunpopular, Rutenburg and Paltchinsky. Petrograd, Cronstadt \
and\\nFinland were declared in a state of siege--upon which the \
bourgeois\\n_Novoye Vremya_ (New Times) remarked ironically:\\n\\nWhy the \
state of siege? The Government is no longer a power. It has\\nno moral \
authority and it does not possess the necessary apparatus to\\nuse force.... \
In the most favourable circumstances it can only\\nnegotiate with any one who \
consents to parley. Its authority goes no\\nfarther....\\n\\nMonday morning, \
the 5th, I dropped in at the Marinsky Palace, to\\nsee what was happening in \
the Council of the Russian Republic.\\nBitter debate on Terestchenko\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s foreign policy. Echoes of the\\nBurtzev-Verkhovski \
affair. All the diplomats present except the\\nItalian ambassador, who \
everybody said was prostrated by the Carso\\ndisaster....\\n\\nAs I came in, \
the Left Socialist Revolutionary Karelin was reading\\naloud an editorial \
from the London _Times_ which said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The remedy\\nfor \
Bolshevism is bullets!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Turning to the Cadets he \
cried, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nwhat _you_ think, \
too!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nVoices from the Right, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes! Yes!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, I know you think so,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
answered Karelin, hotly. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But you haven\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nthe courage to try \
it!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen Skobeliev, looking like a \
matin\[EAcute]e idol with his soft blond beard\\nand wavy yellow hair, rather \
apologetically defending the Soviet\\n_nakaz._ Terestchenko followed, \
assailed from the Left by cries of\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Resignation! \
Resignation!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He insisted that the delegates of \
the\\nGovernment and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ to Paris should have a \
common\\npoint of view--his own. A few words about the restoration \
of\\ndiscipline in the army, about war to victory.... Tumult, and over \
the\\nstubborn opposition of the truculent Left, the Council of \
the\\nRepublic passed to the simple order of the day.\\n\\nThere stretched \
the rows of Bolshevik seats--empty since that first\\nday when they left the \
Council, carrying with them so much life. As I\\nwent down the stairs it \
seemed to me that in spite of the bitter\\nwrangling, no real voice from the \
rough world outside could penetrate\\nthis high, cold hall, and that the \
Provisional Government was\\nwrecked--on the same rock of War and Peace that \
had wrecked the\\nMiliukov Ministry.... The doorman grumbled as he put on my \
coat, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what is becoming \
of poor Russia. All these Mensheviki and\\nBolsheviki and Trudoviki.... This \
Ukraine and this Finland and the\\nGerman imperialists and the English \
imperialists. I am forty-five\\nyears old, and in all my life I never heard \
so many words as in this\\nplace....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the \
corridor I met Professor Shatsky, a rat-faced individual in a\\ndapper \
frock-coat, very influential in the councils of the Cadet\\nparty. I asked \
him what he thought of the much-talked-of Bolshevik\\n_vystuplennie._ He \
shrugged, sneering.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They are cattle--_canaille,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ he answered. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They will not \
dare, or if\\nthey dare they will soon be sent flying. From our point of view \
it\\nwill not be bad, for then they will ruin themselves and have no \
power\\nin the Constituent Assembly....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But, my \
dear sir, allow me to outline to you my plan for a form of\\nGovernment to be \
submitted to the Constituent Assembly. You see, I am\\nchairman of a \
commission appointed from this body, in conjunction\\nwith the Provisional \
Government, to work out a constitutional\\nproject.... We will have a \
legislative assembly of two chambers, such\\nas you have in the United \
States. In the lower chamber will be\\nterritorial representatives; in the \
upper, representatives of the\\nliberal professions, zemstvos, \
Cooperatives--and Trade Unions....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOutside a \
chill, damp wind came from the west, and the cold mud\\nunderfoot soaked \
through my shoes. Two companies of _yunkers_ passed\\nswinging up the \
Morskaya, tramping stiffly in their long coats and\\nsinging an oldtime \
crashing chorus, such as the soldiers used to sing\\nunder the Tsar.... At \
the first cross-street I noticed that the City\\nMilitiamen were mounted, and \
armed with revolvers in bright new\\nholsters; a little group of people stood \
silently staring at them. At\\nthe corner of the Nevsky I bought a pamphlet \
by Lenin, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Will the\\nBolsheviki be Able to Hold the \
Power?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] paying for it with one of the\\nstamps which \
did duty for small change. The usual street-cars crawled\\npast, citizens and \
soldiers clinging to the outside in a way to make\\nTheodore P. Shonts green \
with envy.... Along the sidewalk a row of\\ndeserters in uniform sold \
cigarettes and sunflower seeds....\\n\\nUp the Nevsky in the sour twilight \
crowds were battling for the\\nlatest papers, and knots of people were trying \
to make out the\\nmultitudes of appeals (See App. III, Sect. 6) and \
proclamations\\npasted in every flat place; from the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ \
the\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist parties, the \
Army\\nCommittees--threatening, cursing, beseeching the workers and \
soldiers\\nto stay home, to support the Government....\\n\\nAn armoured \
automobile went slowly up and down, siren screaming. On\\nevery corner, in \
every open space, thick groups were clustered;\\narguing soldiers and \
students. Night came swiftly down, the\\nwide-spaced street-lights flickered \
on, the tides of people flowed\\nendlessly.... It is always like that in \
Petrograd just before trouble....\\n\\nThe city was nervous, starting at \
every sharp sound. But still no\\nsign from the Bolsheviki; the soldiers \
stayed in the barracks, the\\nworkmen in the factories.... We went to a \
moving picture show near the\\nKazan Cathedral--a bloody Italian film of \
passion and intrigue. Down\\nfront were some soldiers and sailors, staring at \
the screen in\\nchildlike wonder, totally unable to comprehend why there \
should be so\\nmuch violent running about, and so much homicide....\\n\\nFrom \
there I hurried to Smolny. In room 10 on the top floor, the\\nMilitary \
Revolutionary Committee sat in continuous session, under the\\nchairmanship \
of a tow-headed, eighteen-year-old boy named Lazimir. He\\nstopped, as he \
passed, to shake hands rather \
bashfully.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Peter-Paul Fortress has just come over \
to us,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he, with a\\npleased grin. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A minute ago we got word from a regiment that \
was\\nordered by the Government to come to Petrograd. The men \
were\\nsuspicious, so they stopped the train at Gatchina and sent \
a\\ndelegation to us. \[OpenCurlyQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the matter?\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] they asked. \[OpenCurlyQuote]What have you got\\nto say? \
We have just passed a resolution, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All Power to \
the\\nSoviets.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\[CloseCurlyQuote]... The Military \
Revolutionary Committee sent back word,\\n\[OpenCurlyQuote]Brothers! We greet \
you in the name of the Revolution. Stay where you\\nare until further \
instructions!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAll telephones, \
he said, were cut off: but communication with the\\nfactories and barracks \
was established by means of military\\ntelephonograph apparatus....\\n\\nA \
steady stream of couriers and Commissars came and went. Outside the\\ndoor \
waited a dozen volunteers, ready to carry word to the farthest\\nquarters of \
the city. One of them, a gypsy-faced man in the uniform\\nof a lieutenant, \
said in French, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Everything is ready to move at \
the\\npush of a button....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThere passed \
Podvoisky, the thin, bearded civillian whose brain\\nconceived the strategy \
of insurrection; Antonov, unshaven, his collar\\nfilthy, drunk with loss of \
sleep; Krylenko, the squat, wide-faced\\nsoldier, always smiling, with his \
violent gestures and tumbling\\nspeech; and Dybenko, the giant bearded sailor \
with the placid face.\\nThese were the men of the hour--and of other hours to \
come.\\n\\nDownstairs in the office of the Factory-Shop Committees sat \
Seratov,\\nsigning orders on the Government Arsenal for arms--one hundred and\
\\nfifty rifles for each factory.... Delegates waited in line, forty \
of\\nthem....\\n\\nIn the hall I ran into some of the minor Bolshevik \
leaders. One\\nshowed me a revolver. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The game is on,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, and his face was\\npale. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Whether we move or not the other side knows it must \
finish us\\nor be finished....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Petrograd \
Soviet was meeting day and night. As I came into the\\ngreat hall Trotzky was \
just finishing.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are asked,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]if we intend to have \
a _vystuplennie._ I\\ncan give a clear answer to that question. The Petrograd \
Soviet feels\\nthat at last the moment has arrived when the power must fall \
into the\\nhands of the Soviets. This transfer of government will \
be\\naccomplished by the All-Russian Congress. Whether an \
armed\\ndemonstration is necessary will depend on... those who wish \
to\\ninterfere with the All-Russian \
Congress....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We feel that our Government, \
entrusted to the personnel of the\\nProvisional Cabinet, is a pitiful and \
helpless Government, which only\\nawaits the sweep of the broom of History to \
give way to a really\\npopular Government. But we are trying to avoid a \
conflict, even now,\\nto-day. We hope that the All-Russian Congress will \
take... into its\\nhands that power and authority which rests upon the \
organised freedom\\nof the people. If, however, the Government wants to \
utilise the short\\nperiod it is expected to live--twenty-four, forty-eight, \
or\\nseventy-two hours--to attack us, then we shall answer \
with\\ncounter-attacks, blow for blow, steel for \
iron!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAmid cheers he announced that the Left \
Socialist Revolutionaries had\\nagreed to send representatives into the \
Military Revolutionary\\nCommittee....\\n\\nAs I left Smolny, at three o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in the morning, I noticed that two\\nrapid-firing \
guns had been mounted, one on each side of the door, and\\nthat strong \
patrols of soldiers guarded the gates and the near-by\\nstreet-corners. Bill \
Shatov[12] came bounding up the steps. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\ncried, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re off! Kerensky sent the _yunkers_ to close down \
our\\npapers, _Soldat_ and _Rabotchi Put._ But our troops went down \
and\\nsmashed the Government seals, and now we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re sending \
detachments to\\nseize the bourgeois newspaper offices!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Exultantly he slapped me on\\nthe shoulder, and ran \
in....\\n\\n[12] Well known in the American labor movement.\\n\\nOn the \
morning of the 6th I had business with the censor, whose\\noffice was in the \
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Everywhere, on all the\\nwalls, hysterical \
appeals to the people to remain \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]calm.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Polkovnikov\\nemitted _prikaz_ after \
_prikaz:_\\n\\nI order all military units and detachments to remain in \
their\\nbarracks until further orders from the Staff of the \
Military\\nDistrict.... All officers who act without orders from their \
superiors\\nwill be court-martialled for mutiny. I forbid absolutely \
any\\nexecution by soldiers of instructions from other \
organisations....\\n\\nThe morning papers announced that the Government had \
suppressed the\\npapers _Novaya Rus, Zhivoye Slovo, Rabotchi Put_ and \
_Soldat,_ and\\ndecreed the arrest of the leaders of the Petrograd Soviet and \
the\\nmembers of the Military Revolutionary Committee....\\n\\nAs I crossed \
the Palace Square several batteries of _yunker_\\nartillery came through the \
Red Arch at a jingling trot, and drew up\\nbefore the Palace. The great red \
building of the General Staff was\\nunusually animated, several armoured \
automobiles ranked before the\\ndoor, and motors full of officers were coming \
and going.... The censor\\nwas very much excited, like a small boy at a \
circus. Kerensky, he\\nsaid, had just gone to the Council of the Republic to \
offer his\\nresignation. I hurried down to the Marinsky Palace, arriving at \
the\\nend of that passionate and almost incoherent speech of Kerensky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s,\\nfull of self-justification and bitter denunciation of \
his enemies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I will cite here the most \
characteristic passage from a whole series\\nof articles published in \
_Rabotchi Put_ by Ulianov-Lenin, a state\\ncriminal who is in hiding and whom \
we are trying to find.... This state\\ncriminal has invited the proletariat \
and the Petrograd garrison to\\nrepeat the experience of the 16th-18th of \
July, and insists upon the\\nimmediate necessity for an armed rising.... \
Moreover, other Bolshevik\\nleaders have taken the floor in a series of \
meetings, and also made\\nan appeal to immediate insurrection. Particularly \
should be noticed\\nthe activity of the present president of the Petrograd \
Soviet,\\nBronstein-Trotzky....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I ought to bring \
to your notice... that the expressions and the style\\nof a whole series of \
articles in _Rabotchi Put_ and _Soldat_ resemble\\nabsolutely those of \
_Novaya Rus...._ We have to do not so much with the\\nmovement of such and \
such political party, as with the exploitation\\nof the political ignorance \
and criminal instincts of a part of the\\npopulation, a sort of organisation \
whose object it is to provoke in\\nRussia, cost what it may, an inconscient \
movement of destruction and\\npillage; for given the state of mind of the \
masses, any movement at\\nPetrograd will be followed by the most terrible \
massacres, which will\\ncover with eternal shame the name of free \
Russia....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... By the admission of Ulianov-Lenin \
himself, the situation of the\\nextreme left wing of the Social Democrats in \
Russia is very\\nfavourable.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Here Kerensky read the \
following quotation from Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\narticle.):\\n\\nThink of \
it!... The German comrades have only one Liebknecht, without\\nnewspapers, \
without freedom of meeting, without a Soviet.... They are\\nopposed by the \
incredible hostility of all classes of society--and yet\\nthe German comrades \
try to act; while we, having dozens of\\nnewspapers, freedom of meeting, the \
majority of the Soviets, we, the\\nbest-placed international proletarians of \
the entire world, can we\\nrefuse to support the German revolutionists and \
insurrectionary\\norganisations?...\\n\\nKerensky then continued:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The organisers of rebellion recognise thus implicitly \
that the most\\nperfect conditions for the free action of a political party \
obtain\\nnow in Russia, administered by a Provisional Government at the \
head\\nof which is, in the eyes of this party, \[OpenCurlyQuote]a usurper and \
a man who has\\nsold himself to the bourgeoisie, the Minister-President \
Kerensky....\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... The organisers \
of the insurrection do not come to the aid of the\\nGerman proletariat, but \
of the German governing classes, and they\\nopen the Russian front to the \
iron fists of Wilhelm and his friends....\\nLittle matter to the Provisional \
Government the motives of these\\npeople, little matter if they act \
consciously or unconsciously; but\\nin any case, from this tribune, in full \
consciousness of my\\nresponsibility, I quality such acts of a Russian \
political party as\\nacts of treason to \
Russia!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... I place myself at the point of view \
of the Right, and I propose\\nimmediately to proceed to an investigation and \
make the necessary\\narrests.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Uproar from the Left.) \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Listen to me!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried in \
a\\npowerful voice. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At the moment when the state is in \
danger, because\\nof conscious or unconscious treason, the Provisional \
Government, and\\nmyself among others, prefer to be killed rather than betray \
the life,\\nthe honour and the independence of Russia....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt this moment a paper was handed to \
Kerensky.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have just received the proclamation \
which they are distributing to\\nthe regiments. Here is the contents.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Reading: \
_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]The Petrograd\\nSoviet of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies is menaced. We \
order\\nimmediately the regiments to mobilise on a war footing and to \
await\\nnew orders. All delay or non-execution of this order will \
be\\nconsidered as an act of treason to the Revolution. The \
Military\\nRevolutionary Committee. For the President, Podvoisky. The \
Secretary,\\nAntonov.\[CloseCurlyQuote]_\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In \
reality, this is an attempt to raise the populace against the\\nexisting \
order of things, to break the Constituent and to open the\\nfront to the \
regiments of the iron fist of Wilhelm....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I say \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]populace\[CloseCurlyQuote] intentionally, because the \
conscious democracy and\\nits _Tsay-ee-kah,_ all the Army organisations, all \
that free Russia\\nglorifies, the good sense, the honour and the conscience \
of the great\\nRussian democracy, protests against these things....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have not come here with a prayer, but to state my \
firm conviction\\nthat the Provisional Government, which defends at this \
moment our new\\nliberty--that the new Russian state, destined to a brilliant \
future,\\nwill find unanimous support except among those who have never dared\
\\nto face the truth....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... The Provisional \
Government has never violated the liberty of all\\ncitizens of the State to \
use their political rights.... But now the\\nProvisional Government.... \
declares: in this moment those elements of\\nthe Russian nation, those groups \
and parties who have dared to lift\\ntheir hands against the free will of the \
Russian people, at the same\\ntime threatening to open the front to Germany, \
must be liquidated\\nwith decision!...\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let the \
population of Petrograd understand that it will encounter a\\nfirm power, and \
perhaps at the last moment good sense, conscience and\\nhonour will triumph \
in the hearts of those who still possess \
them....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAll through this speech, the hall rang \
with deafening clamour. When\\nthe Minister-President had stepped down, \
pale-faced and wet with\\nperspiration, and strode out with his suite of \
officers, speaker\\nafter speaker from the Left and Centre attacked the \
Right, all one\\nangry roaring. Even the Socialist Revolutionaries, through \
Gotz:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The policy of the Bolsheviki is demagogic \
and criminal, in their\\nexploitation of the popular discontent. But there is \
a whole series\\nof popular demands which have received no satisfaction up to \
now....\\nThe questions of peace, land and the democratization of the \
army\\nought to be stated in such a fashion that no soldier, peasant \
or\\nworker would have the least doubt that our Government is \
attempting,\\nfirmly and infallibly, to solve them....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We Mensheviki do not wish to provoke a Cabinet crisis, \
and we are\\nready to defend the Provisional Government with all our energy, \
to\\nthe last drop of our blood--if only the Provisional Government, on \
all\\nthese burning questions, will speak the clear and precise \
words\\nawaited by the people with such \
impatience....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen Martov, furious:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The words of the Minister-President, who allowed \
himself to speak of\\n\[OpenCurlyQuote]populace\[CloseCurlyQuote] when it is \
question of the movement of important sections\\nof the proletariat and the \
army--although led in the wrong\\ndirection--are nothing but an incitement to \
civil war.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe order of the day proposed by the \
Left was voted. It amounted\\npractically to a vote of lack of confidence.\\n\
\\n1. The armed demonstration which has been preparing for some days\\npast \
has for its object a _coup d\[CloseCurlyQuote]etat,_ threatens to \
provoke\\ncivil war, creates conditions favourable to _pogroms_ \
and\\ncounterrevolution, the mobilization of counter-revolutionary \
forces,\\nsuch as the Black Hundreds, which will inevitably bring about \
the\\nimpossibility of convoking the Constituent, will cause a \
military\\ncatastrophe, the death of the Revolution, paralyse the economic \
life\\nof the country and destroy Russia;\\n\\n2. The conditions favourable \
to this agitation have been created by\\ndelay in passing urgent measures, as \
well as objective conditions\\ncaused by the war and the general disorder. It \
is necessary before\\neverything to promulgate at once a decree transmitting \
the land to\\nthe peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Land Committees, and to adopt an \
energetic course of\\naction abroad in proposing to the Allies to proclaim \
their peace\\nterms and to begin peace-parleys;\\n\\n3. To cope with \
Monarchist manifestations and _pogromist_ movements,\\nit is indispensable to \
take immediate measures to suppress these\\nmovements, and for this purpose \
to create at Petrograd a Committee of\\nPublic Safety, composed of \
representatives of the Municipality and\\nthe organs of the revolutionary \
democracy, acting in contact with the\\nProvisional Government....\\n\\nIt is \
interesting to note that the Mensheviki and Socialist\\nRevolutionaries all \
rallied to this resolution.... When Kerensky saw\\nit, however, he summoned \
Avksentiev to the Winter Palace to explain.\\nIf it expressed a lack of \
confidence in the Provisional Government,\\nhe begged Avksentiev to form a \
new Cabinet. Dan, Gotz and Avksentiev,\\nthe leaders of the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]compromisers,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] performed their \
last compromise....\\nThey explained to Kerensky that it was not meant as a \
criticism of\\nthe Government!\\n\\nAt the corner of the Morskaya and the \
Nevsky, squads of soldiers with\\nfixed bayonets were stopping all private \
automobiles, turning out the\\noccupants, and ordering them toward the Winter \
Palace. A large crowd\\nhad gathered to watch them. Nobody knew whether the \
soldiers belonged\\nto the Government or the Military Revolutionary \
Committee. Up in\\nfront of the Kazan Cathedral the same thing was happening, \
machines\\nbeing directed back up the Nevsky. Five or six sailors with rifles\
\\ncame along, laughing excitedly, and fell into conversation with two\\nof \
the soldiers. On the sailors\[CloseCurlyQuote] hat bands were _Avrora_ and \
_Zaria\\nSvobody,_--the names of the leading Bolshevik cruisers of the Baltic\
\\nFleet. One of them said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Cronstadt is coming!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... It was as if, in\\n1792, on the streets of Paris, \
some one had said: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Marseillais\\nare coming!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] For at Cronstadt were twenty-five thousand \
sailors,\\nconvinced Bolsheviki and not afraid to die....\\n\\n_Rabotchi i \
Soldat_ was just out, all its front page one huge\\nproclamation: SOLDIERS! \
WORKERS! CITIZENS!\\n\\nThe enemies of the people passed last night to the \
offensive. The\\nKornilovists of the Staff are trying to draw in from the \
suburbs\\n_yunkers_ and volunteer battalions. The Oranienbaum _yunkers_ and \
the\\nTsarskoye Selo volunteers refused to come out. A stroke of \
high\\ntreason is being contemplated against the Petrograd Soviet.... \
The\\ncampaign of the counter-revolutionists is being directed against \
the\\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets on the eve of its opening, \
against\\nthe Constituent Assembly, against the people. The Petrograd Soviet \
is\\nguarding the Revolution. The Military Revolutionary Committee \
is\\ndirecting the repulse of the conspirators\[CloseCurlyQuote] attack. The \
entire\\ngarrison and proletariat of Petrograd are ready to deal the enemy of\
\\nthe people a crushing blow.\\n\\nThe Military Revolutionary Committee \
decrees:\\n\\n1. All regimental, division and battle-ship Committees, \
together with\\nthe Soviet Commissars, and all revolutionary organisations, \
shall\\nmeet in continuous session, concentrating in their hands \
all\\ninformation about the plans of the conspirators.\\n\\n2. Not one \
soldier shall leave his division without permission of \
the\\nCommittee.\\n\\n3. To send to Smolny at once two delegates from each \
military unit\\nand five from each Ward Soviet.\\n\\n4. All members of the \
Petrograd Soviet and all delegates to the\\nAll-Russian Congress are invited \
immediately to Smolny for an\\nextraordinary meeting.\\n\\nCounter-revolution \
has raised its criminal head.\\n\\nA great danger threatens all the conquests \
and hopes of the soldiers\\nand workers.\\n\\nBut the forces of the \
Revolution by far exceed those of its enemies.\\n\\nThe cause of the People \
is in strong hands. The conspirators will be\\ncrushed.\\n\\nNo hesitation or \
doubts! Firmness, steadfastness, discipline,\\ndetermination!\\n\\nLong live \
the Revolution!\\n\\n_The Military Revolutionary Committee._\\n\\nThe \
Petrograd Soviet was meeting continuously at Smolny, a centre of\\nstorm, \
delegates falling down asleep on the floor and rising again to\\ntake part in \
the debate, Trotzky, Kameniev, Volodarsky speaking six,\\neight, twelve hours \
a day....\\n\\nI went down to room 18 on the first floor where the \
Bolshevik\\ndelegates were holding caucus, a harsh voice steadily booming, \
the\\nspeaker hidden by the crowd: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The compromisers \
say that we are\\nisolated. Pay no attention to them. Once it begins they \
must be\\ndragged along with us, or else lose their following....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHere he held up a piece of paper. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are dragging them! A message\\nhas just come from \
the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries! They\\nsay that they condemn \
our action, but that if the Government attacks\\nus they will not oppose the \
cause of the proletariat!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Exultant\\nshouting....\\n\\nAs night fell the great hall filled with \
soldiers and workmen, a\\nmonstrous dun mass, deep-humming in a blue haze of \
smoke. The old\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ had finally decided to welcome the delegates \
to that\\nnew Congress which would mean its own ruin--and perhaps the ruin of\
\\nthe revolutionary order it had built. At this meeting, however, \
only\\nmembers of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ could vote....\\n\\nIt was after midnight \
when Gotz took the chair and Dan rose to speak,\\nin a tense silence, which \
seemed to me almost menacing.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The hours in which \
we live appear in the most tragic colours,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nsaid. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The enemy is at the gates of Petrograd, the forces of \
the\\ndemocracy are trying to organise to resist him, and yet we \
await\\nbloodshed in the streets of the capital, and famine threatens \
to\\ndestroy, not only our homogeneous Government, but the \
Revolution\\nitself....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The masses are sick and \
exhausted. They have no interest in the\\nRevolution. If the Bolsheviki start \
anything, that will be the end of\\nthe Revolution...\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
(Cries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a lie!)\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
counter-revolutionists\\nare waiting with the Bolsheviki to begin riots and \
massacres.... If\\nthere is any _vystuplennie,_ there will be no Constituent \
Assembly....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n(Cries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Lie! \
Shame!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote])\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is \
inadmissible that in the zone of military operations the\\nPetrograd garrison \
shall not submit to the orders of the Staff.... You\\nmust obey the orders of \
the Staff and of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ elected by\\nyou. All Power to the \
Soviets--that means death! Robbers and thieves\\nare waiting for the moment \
to loot and burn.... When you have such\\nslogans put before you, \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Enter the houses, take away the shoes and\\nclothes from the \
bourgeoisie--\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Tumult. Cries, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No such slogan! A\\nlie! A \
lie!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]) \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, it may start \
differently, but it will end that\\nway!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
_Tsay-ee-kah_ has full power to act, and must be obeyed.... We are\\nnot \
afraid of bayonets.... The _Tsay-ee-kah_ will defend the Revolution\\nwith \
its body....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Cries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was a \
dead body long ago!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote])\\n\\nImmense continued uproar, \
in which his voice could be heard\\nscreaming, as he pounded the desk, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Those who are urging this are\\ncommitting a crime!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nVoice: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You committed a \
crime long ago, when you captured the power\\nand turned it over to the \
bourgeoisie!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nGotz, ringing the chairman\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bell: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Silence, or I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll have you put\\nout!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nVoice: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Try it!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Cheers and \
whistling.)\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now concerning our policy about \
peace.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Laughter.) \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Unfortunately\\nRussia can no longer support the \
continuation of the war. There is\\ngoing to be peace, but not permanent \
peace--not a democratic peace....\\nTo-day, at the Council of the Republic, \
in order to avoid bloodshed,\\nwe passed an order of the day demanding the \
surrender of the land to\\nthe Land Committees and immediate peace \
negotiations....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Laughter,\\nand cries, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Too late!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote])\\n\\nThen for the \
Bolsheviki, Trotzky mounted the tribune, borne on a wave\\nof roaring \
applause that burst into cheers and a rising house,\\nthunderous. His thin, \
pointed face was positively Mephistophelian in\\nits expression of malicious \
irony.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Dan\[CloseCurlyQuote]s tactics prove that \
the masses--the great, dull, indifferent\\nmasses--are absolutely with him!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Titantic mirth.) He turned toward\\nthe chairman, \
dramatically. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When we spoke of giving the land to \
the\\npeasants, you were against it. We told the peasants, \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]If they don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\ngive it to you, take it \
yourselves!\[CloseCurlyQuote] and the peasants followed our\\nadvice. And now \
you advocate what we did six months ago....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s order to suspend the \
death penalty in the\\narmy was dictated by his ideals. I think Kerensky was \
persuaded by\\nthe Petrograd garrison, which refused to obey him....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To-day Dan is accused of having made a speech in the \
Council of the\\nRepublic which proves him to be a secret Bolshevik.... The \
time may\\ncome when Dan will say that the flower of the Revolution \
participated\\nin the rising of July 16th and 18th.... In Dan\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s resolution to-day at\\nthe Council of the Republic there \
was no mention of enforcing\\ndiscipline in the army, although that is urged \
in the propaganda of\\nhis party....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No. The \
history of the last seven months shows that the masses have\\nleft the \
Mensheviki. The Mensheviki and the Socialist Revolutionaries\\nconquered the \
Cadets, and then when they got the power, they gave it\\nto the Cadets....\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Dan tells you that you have no right to make an \
insurrection.\\nInsurrection is the right of all revolutionists! When \
the\\ndown-trodden masses revolt, it is their right....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen the long-faced, cruel-tongued Lieber, \
greeted with groans and\\nlaughter.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Engels and \
Marx said that the proletariat had no right to take power\\nuntil it was \
ready for it. In a bourgeois revolution like this.... the\\nseizure of power \
by the masses means the tragic end of the\\nRevolution.... Trotzky, as a \
Social Democratic theorist, is himself\\nopposed to what he is now \
advocating....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Cries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Enough! \
Down with\\nhim!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote])\\n\\nMartov, constantly \
interrupted: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Internationalists are not\\nopposed \
to the transmission of power to the democracy, but they\\ndisapprove of the \
methods of the Bolsheviki. This is not the moment\\nto seize the power....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAgain Dan took the floor, violently protesting \
against the action of\\nthe Military Revolutionary Committee, which had sent \
a Commissar to\\nseize the office of _Izviestia_ and censor the paper. The \
wildest\\nuproar followed. Martov tried to speak, but could not be \
heard.\\nDelegates of the Army and the Baltic Fleet stood up all over \
the\\nhall, shouting that the Soviet was _their_ Government....\\n\\nAmid the \
wildest confusion Ehrlich offered a resolution, appealing to\\nthe workers \
and soldiers to remain calm and not to respond to\\nprovocations to \
demonstrate, recognising the necessity of immediately\\ncreating a Committee \
of Public Safety, and asking the Provisional\\nGovernment at once to pass \
decrees transferring the land to the\\npeasants and beginning peace \
negotiations....\\n\\nThen up leaped Volodarsky, shouting harshly that the \
_Tsay-ee-kah,_\\non the eve of the Congress, had no right to assume the \
functions of\\nthe Congress. The _Tsay-ee-kah_ was practically dead, he said, \
and\\nthe resolution was simply a trick to bolster up its waning power....\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As for us, Bolsheviki, we will not vote on this \
resolution!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nWhereupon all the Bolsheviki left the \
hall and the resolution was\\npassed....\\n\\nToward four in the morning I \
met Zorin in the outer hall, a rifle\\nslung from his shoulder.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re moving!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
(See App. III, Sect. 7) said he, calmly but with\\nsatisfaction. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We pinched the Assistant Minister of Justice and \
the\\nMinister of Religions. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re down cellar now. One \
regiment is on\\nthe march to capture the Telephone Exchange, another the \
Telegraph\\nAgency, another the State Bank. The Red Guard is out....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the steps of Smolny, in the chill dark, we \
first saw the Red\\nGuard--a huddled group of boys in workmen\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s clothes, carrying guns\\nwith bayonets, talking nervously \
together.\\n\\nFar over the still roofs westward came the sound of scattered \
rifle\\nfire, where the _yunkers_ were trying to open the bridges over \
the\\nNeva, to prevent the factory workers and soldiers of the \
Viborg\\nquarter from joining the Soviet forces in the centre of the city; \
and\\nthe Cronstadt sailors were closing them again....\\n\\nBehind us great \
Smolny, bright with lights, hummed like a \
gigantic\\nhive....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter IV\\n\\nThe Fall of the Provisional \
Government\\n\\n\\nWednesday, November 7th, I rose very late. The noon cannon \
boomed\\nfrom Peter-Paul as I went down the Nevsky. It was a raw, chill \
day.\\nIn front of the State Bank some soldiers with fixed bayonets \
were\\nstanding at the closed gates.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What side do \
you belong to?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
Government?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No more \
Government,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one answered with a grin, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Slava Bogu!_ Glory\\nto God!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
That was all I could get out of him....\\n\\nThe street-cars were running on \
the Nevsky, men, women and small\\nboys hanging on every projection. Shops \
were open, and there seemed\\neven less uneasiness among the street crowds \
than there had been the\\nday before. A whole crop of new appeals against \
insurrection had\\nblossomed out on the walls during the night--to the \
peasants, to the\\nsoldiers at the front, to the workmen of Petrograd. One \
read:\\n\\nFROM THE PETROGRAD MUNICIPAL DUMA:\\n\\nThe Municipal Duma informs \
the citizens that in the extraordinary\\nmeeting of November 6th the Duma \
formed a Committee of Public\\nSafety, composed of members of the Central and \
Ward Dumas, and\\nrepresentatives of the following revolutionary \
democratic\\norganizations: The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the All-Russian \
Executive\\nCommittee of Peasant Deputies, the Army organisations, \
the\\n_Tsentroflot,_ the Petrograd Soviet of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies (!), the Council of Trade Unions, and \
others.\\n\\nMembers of the Committee of Public Safety will be on duty in the\
\\nbuilding of the Municipal Duma. Telephones No. 15-40, 223-77, \
138-36.\\n\\nNovember 7th, 1917.\\n\\nThough I didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
realize it then, this was the Duma\[CloseCurlyQuote]s declaration of\\nwar \
against the Bolsheviki.\\n\\nI bought a copy of _Rabotchi Put,_ the only \
newspaper which seemed\\non sale, and a little later paid a soldier fifty \
kopeks for a\\nsecond-hand copy of _Dien._ The Bolshevik paper, printed \
on\\nlarge-sized sheets in the conquered office of the _Russkaya \
Volia,_\\nhad huge headlines: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ALL POWER--TO THE \
SOVIETS OF WORKERS, SOLDIERS\\nAND PEASANTS! PEACE! BREAD! LAND!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The leading article was signed\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Zinoviev,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--Lenin\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s companion in hiding. It began:\\n\\nEvery soldier, every \
worker, every real Socialist, every honest\\ndemocrat realises that there are \
only two alternatives to the\\npresent situation.\\n\\nEither--the power will \
remain in the hands of the bourgeois-landlord\\ncrew, and this will mean \
every kind of repression for the workers,\\nsoldiers and peasants, \
continuation of the war, inevitable hunger\\nand death....\\n\\nOr--the power \
will be transferred to the hands of the revolutionary\\nworkers, soldiers and \
peasants; and in that case it will mean a\\ncomplete abolition of landlord \
tyranny, immediate check of the\\ncapitalists, immediate proposal of a just \
peace. Then the land is\\nassured to the peasants, then control of industry \
is assured to the\\nworkers, then bread is assured to the hungry, then the \
end of this\\nnonsensical war!...\\n\\n_Dien_ contained fragmentary news of \
the agitated night. Bolsheviki\\ncapture of the Telephone Exchange, the \
Baltic station, the Telegraph\\nAgency; the Peterhof _yunkers_ unable to \
reach Petrograd; the\\nCossacks undecided; arrest of some of the Ministers; \
shooting of\\nChief of the City Militia Meyer; arrests, \
counter-arrests,\\nskirmishes between clashing patrols of soldiers, _yunkers_ \
and Red\\nGuards. (See App. IV, Sect. 1)\\n\\nOn the corner of the Morskaya I \
ran into Captain Gomberg, Menshevik\\n_oboronetz,_ secretary of the Military \
Section of his party. When I\\nasked him if the insurrection had really \
happened he shrugged his\\nshoulders in a tired manner and replied, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Tchort znayet!_ The devil\\nknows! Well, perhaps the \
Bolsheviki can seize the power, but they\\nwon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be able to \
hold it more than three days. They haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the men\\nto run \
a government. Perhaps it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a good thing to let them \
try--that\\nwill furnish them....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Military \
Hotel at the corner of St. Isaac\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Square was picketed\\nby \
armed sailors. In the lobby were many of the smart young\\nofficers, walking \
up and down or muttering together; the sailors\\nwouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
let them leave....\\n\\nSuddenly came the sharp crack of a rifle outside, \
followed by a\\nscattered burst of firing. I ran out. Something unusual was \
going on\\naround the Marinsky Palace, where the Council of the \
Russian\\nRepublic met. Diagonally across the wide square was drawn a line of\
\\nsoldiers, rifles ready, staring at the hotel roof.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Provacatzia!_ Shot at us!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
snapped one, while another went running\\ntoward the door.\\n\\nAt the \
western corner of the Palace lay a big armoured car with a\\nred flag flying \
from it, newly lettered in red paint: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]S.R.S.D.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n(_Soviet Rabotchikh Soldatskikh Deputatov_); all \
the guns trained\\ntoward St. Isaac\[CloseCurlyQuote]s. A barricade had been \
heaped up across the mouth\\nof Novaya Ulitza--boxes, barrels, an old \
bed-spring, a wagon. A pile\\nof lumber barred the end of the Moika quay. \
Short logs from a\\nneighbouring wood-pile were being built up along the \
front of the\\nbuilding to form \
breastworks....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Is there going to be any \
fighting?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Soon, \
soon,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered a soldier, nervously. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Go away, comrade,\\nyou\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll get hurt. \
They will come from that direction,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] pointing\\ntoward \
the Admiralty.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who \
will?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That I couldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t tell you, brother,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he answered, \
and spat.\\n\\nBefore the door of the Palace was a crowd of soldiers and \
sailors. A\\nsailor was telling of the end of the Council of the \
Russian\\nRepublic. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We walked in there,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]and filled all the \
doors\\nwith comrades. I went up to the counter-revolutionist \
Kornilovitz\\nwho sat in the president\[CloseCurlyQuote]s chair. \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]No more Council,\[CloseCurlyQuote] I says. \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Run\\nalong home now!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThere was laughter. By waving assorted papers I \
managed to get\\naround to the door of the press gallery. There an enormous \
smiling\\nsailor stopped me, and when I showed my pass, just said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If you\\nwere Saint Michael himself, comrade, you \
couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t pass here!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nThrough the \
glass of the door I made out the distorted face and\\ngesticulating arms of a \
French correspondent, locked in....\\n\\nAround in front stood a little, \
grey-moustached man in the uniform\\nof a general, the centre of a knot of \
soldiers. He was very red in\\nthe face.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am \
General Alexeyev,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As \
your superior officer and as\\na member of the Council of the Republic I \
demand to be allowed to\\npass!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The guard scratched \
his head, looking uneasily out of the\\ncorner of his eye; he beckoned to an \
approaching officer, who grew\\nvery agitated when he saw who it was and \
saluted before he realised\\nwhat he was \
doing.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Vashe Vuisokoprevoskhoditelstvo_--your \
High Excellency--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nstammered, in the manner of \
the old r\[EAcute]gime, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Access to the Palace \
is\\nstrictly forbidden--I have no right--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAn \
automobile came by, and I saw Gotz sitting inside, laughing\\napparently with \
great amusement. A few minutes later another, with\\narmed soldiers on the \
front seat, full of arrested members of the\\nProvisional Government. Peters, \
Lettish member of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee, came hurrying \
across the Square.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I thought you bagged all those \
gentlemen last night,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said I,\\npointing to \
them.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he answered, \
with the expression of a disappointed small boy.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
damn fools let most of them go again before we made up our\\nminds....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDown the Voskressensky Prospect a great mass of \
sailors were drawn\\nup, and behind them came marching soldiers, as far as \
the eye could\\nreach.\\n\\nWe went toward the Winter Palace by way of the \
Admiralteisky. All\\nthe entrances to the Palace Square were closed by \
sentries, and a\\ncordon of troops stretched clear across the western end, \
besieged by\\nan uneasy throng of citizens. Except for far-away soldiers \
who\\nseemed to be carrying wood out of the Palace courtyard and piling \
it\\nin front of the main gateway, everything was quiet.\\n\\nWe couldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t make out whether the sentries were pro-Government \
or\\npro-Soviet. Our papers from Smolny had no effect, however, so \
we\\napproached another part of the line with an important air and \
showed\\nour American passports, saying \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Official \
business!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and shouldered\\nthrough. At the door of \
the Palace the same old _shveitzari,_ in\\ntheir brass-buttoned blue uniforms \
with the red-and-gold collars,\\npolitely took our coats and hats, and we \
went up-stairs. In the\\ndark, gloomy corridor, stripped of its tapestries, a \
few old\\nattendants were lounging about, and in front of Kerensky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s door a\\nyoung officer paced up and down, gnawing his \
moustache. We asked if\\nwe could interview the Minister-president. He bowed \
and clicked his\\nheels.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No, I am sorry,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he replied in French. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Alexander Feodorvitch is\\nextremely occupied just \
now....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He looked at us for a moment. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In\\nfact, he is not \
here....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where is he?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]He has gone to the \
Front. (See App. IV, Sect. 2) And do you know,\\nthere \
wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t enough gasoline for his automobile. We had to send to\
\\nthe English Hospital and borrow some.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are the Ministers here?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They are meeting in some room--I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know where.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are the Bolsheviki \
coming?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course. \
Certainly, they are coming. I expect a telephone call\\nevery minute to say \
that they are coming. But we are ready. We have\\n_yunkers_ in the front of \
the Palace. Through that door there.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Can we go in there?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No. Certainly not. It is not permitted.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Abruptly he shook hands\\nall around and walked \
away. We turned to the forbidden door, set in\\na temporary partition \
dividing the hall and locked on the outside.\\nOn the other side were voices, \
and somebody laughing. Except for\\nthat the vast spaces of the old Palace \
were silent as the grave. An\\nold _shveitzar_ ran up. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No, _barin,_ you must not go in there.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why is the door locked?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To keep the soldiers in,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he answered. After a few minutes he said\\nsomething \
about having a glass of tea and went back up the hall. We\\nunlocked the \
door.\\n\\nJust inside a couple of soldiers stood on guard, but they \
said\\nnothing. At the end of the corridor was a large, ornate room \
with\\ngilded cornices and enormous crystal lustres, and beyond it \
several\\nsmaller ones, wainscoted with dark wood. On both sides of \
the\\nparquetted floor lay rows of dirty mattresses and blankets, \
upon\\nwhich occasional soldiers were stretched out; everywhere was \
a\\nlitter of cigarette-butts, bits of bread, cloth, and empty bottles\\nwith \
expensive French labels. More and more soldiers, with the \
red\\nshoulder-straps of the _yunker_-schools, moved about in a \
stale\\natmosphere of tobacco-smoke and unwashed humanity. One had a \
bottle\\nof white Burgundy, evidently filched from the cellars of the Palace.\
\\nThey looked at us with astonishment as we marched past, through \
room\\nafter room, until at last we came out into a series of \
great\\nstate-salons, fronting their long and dirty windows on the \
Square.\\nThe walls were covered with huge canvases in massive \
gilt\\nframes--historical battle-scenes.... \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]12 October \
1812\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]6 November\\n1812\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]16/28 August 1813.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ... One had a gash across the upper\\nright hand \
corner.\\n\\nThe place was all a huge barrack, and evidently had been for \
weeks,\\nfrom the look of the floor and walls. Machine guns were mounted \
on\\nwindow-sills, rifles stacked between the mattresses.\\n\\nAs we were \
looking at the pictures an alcoholic breath assailed me\\nfrom the region of \
my left ear, and a voice said in thick but fluent\\nFrench, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I see, by the way you admire the paintings, that you \
are\\nforeigners.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He was a short, puffy man with a \
baldish head as he\\nremoved his cap.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Americans? \
Enchanted. I am Stabs--Capitan Vladimir Artzibashev,\\nabsolutely at your \
service.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It did not seem to occur to him that\\nthere \
was anything unusual in four strangers, one a woman, wandering\\nthrough the \
defences of an army awaiting attack. He began to\\ncomplain of the state of \
Russia.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Not only these Bolsheviki,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]but the fine \
traditions of\\nthe Russian army are broken down. Look around you. These are \
all\\nstudents in the officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] training schools. But are \
they gentlemen?\\nKerensky opened the officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] schools to \
the ranks, to any soldier\\nwho could pass an examination. Naturally there \
are many, many who\\nare contaminated by the Revolution....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWithout consequence he changed the subject. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am very anxious to go\\naway from Russia. I have \
made up my mind to join the American army.\\nWill you please go to your \
Consul and make arrangements? I will give\\nyou my address.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In spite of our protestations he wrote it on \
a\\npiece of paper, and seemed to feel better at once. I have it\\nstill--\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Oranien-baumskaya Shkola Praporshtchikov 2nd, Staraya\
\\nPeterhof._\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We had a \
review this morning early,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he went on, as he guided \
us\\nthrough the rooms and explained everything. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
Women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Battalion\\ndecided to remain loyal to the \
Government.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are the women \
soldiers in the \
Palace?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, they are in \
the back rooms, where they won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be hurt if any\\ntrouble \
comes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He sighed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is a \
great responsibility,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he.\\n\\nFor a while we \
stood at the window, looking down on the Square\\nbefore the Palace, where \
three companies of long-coated\\n_yunkers_ were drawn up under arms, being \
harangued by a tall,\\nenergetic-looking officer I recognised as \
Stankievitch, chief\\nMilitary Commissar of the Provisional Government. After \
a few\\nminutes two of the companies shouldered arms with a clash, \
barked\\nthree sharp shouts, and went swinging off across the \
Square,\\ndisappearing through the Red Arch into the quiet city.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They are going to capture the Telephone Exchange,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said some one.\\nThree cadets stood by us, and we \
fell into conversation. They said\\nthey had entered the schools from the \
ranks, and gave their\\nnames--Robert Olev, Alexei Vasilienko and Erni Sachs, \
an Esthonian.\\nBut now they didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to be officers any \
more, because officers\\nwere very unpopular. They didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
seem to know what to do, as a\\nmatter of fact, and it was plain that they \
were not happy.\\n\\nBut soon they began to boast. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If \
the Bolsheviki come we shall show\\nthem how to fight. They do not dare to \
fight, they are cowards. But\\nif we should be overpowered, well, every man \
keeps one bullet for\\nhimself....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt this point \
there was a burst of rifle-fire not far off. Out on\\nthe Square all the \
people began to run, falling flat on their faces,\\nand the _izvoshtchiki,_ \
standing on the corners, galloped in every\\ndirection. Inside all was \
uproar, soldiers running here and there,\\ngrabbing up guns, rifle-belts and \
shouting, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Here they come! Here\\nthey come!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ... But in a few minutes it quieted down again. \
The\\n_izvoshtchiki_ came back, the people lying down stood up. Through\\nthe \
Red Arch appeared the _yunkers,_ marching a little out of step,\\none of them \
supported by two comrades.\\n\\nIt was getting late when we left the Palace. \
The sentries in the\\nSquare had all disappeared. The great semi-circle of \
Government\\nbuildings seemed deserted. We went into the Hotel France for \
dinner,\\nand right in the middle of soup the waiter, very pale in the \
face,\\ncame up and insisted that we move to the main dining-room at \
the\\nback of the house, because they were going to put out the lights \
in\\nthe caf\[EAcute]. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There will be much shooting,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said.\\n\\nWhen we came out on the Morskaya again \
it was quite dark, except for\\none flickering street-light on the corner of \
the Nevsky. Under this\\nstood a big armored automobile, with racing engine \
and oil-smoke\\npouring out of it. A small boy had climbed up the side of the \
thing\\nand was looking down the barrel of a machine gun. Soldiers \
and\\nsailors stood around, evidently waiting for something. We walked\\nback \
up to the Red Arch, where a knot of soldiers was gathered\\nstaring at the \
brightly-lighted Winter Palace and talking in loud\\ntones.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No, comrades,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one was saying. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How can we shoot at them? \
The\\nWomen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Battalion is in there--they will say we have \
fired on Russian\\nwomen.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAs we reached the \
Nevsky again another armoured car came around the\\ncorner, and a man poked \
his head out of the turret-top.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Come on!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he yelled. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s go on through and \
attack!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe driver of the other car came over, \
and shouted so as to be heard\\nabove the roaring engine. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Committee says to wait. They have got\\nartillery \
behind the wood-piles in there....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHere the \
street-cars had stopped running, few people passed, and\\nthere were no \
lights; but a few blocks away we could see the trams,\\nthe crowds, the \
lighted shop-windows and the electric signs of the\\nmoving-picture \
shows--life going on as usual. We had tickets to the\\nBallet at the Marinsky \
Theatre--all theatres were open--but it was too\\nexciting out of \
doors....\\n\\nIn the darkness we stumbled over lumber-piles barricading the \
Police\\nBridge, and before the Stroganov Palace made out some \
soldiers\\nwheeling into position a three-inch field-gun. Men in \
various\\nuniforms were coming and going in an aimless way, and doing a great\
\\ndeal of talking....\\n\\nUp the Nevsky the whole city seemed to be out \
promenading. On every\\ncorner immense crowds were massed around a core of \
hot discussion.\\nPickets of a dozen soldiers with fixed bayonets lounged at \
the\\nstreet-crossings, red-faced old men in rich fur coats shook \
their\\nfists at them, smartly-dressed women screamed epithets; the \
soldiers\\nargued feebly, with embarrassed grins.... Armoured cars went up \
and\\ndown the street, named after the first Tsars--Oleg, \
Rurik,\\nSvietoslav--and daubed with huge red letters, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]R. S. D. R. P.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n_(Rossiskaya \
Partia_)[13]. At the Mikhailovsky a man appeared with an\\narmful of \
newspapers, and was immediately stormed by frantic people,\\noffering a \
rouble, five roubles, ten roubles, tearing at each other\\nlike animals. It \
was _Rabotchi i Soldat,_ announcing the victory of\\nthe Proletarian \
Revolution, the liberation of the Bolsheviki still\\nin prison, calling upon \
the Army front and rear for support... a\\nfeverish little sheet of four \
pages, running to enormous type,\\ncontaining no news....\\n\\n[13] (Russian \
Social Democratic Labor Party).\\n\\nOn the corner of the Sadovaya about two \
thousand citizens had\\ngathered, staring up at the roof of a tall building, \
where a tiny\\nred spark glowed and waned.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said a tall peasant, pointing to it. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is a provocator.\\nPresently he will fire on the \
people....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Apparently no one thought of\\ngoing to \
investigate.\\n\\nThe massive facade of Smolny blazed with lights as we drove \
up, and\\nfrom every street converged upon it streams of hurrying shapes \
dim\\nin the gloom. Automobiles and motorcycles came and went; an \
enormous\\nelephant-coloured armoured automobile, with two red flags \
flying\\nfrom the turret, lumbered out with screaming siren. It was cold, and\
\\nat the outer gate the Red Guards had built themselves a bon-fire. At\\nthe \
inner gate, too, there was a blaze, by the light of which the\\nsentries \
slowly spelled out our passes and looked us up and down.\\nThe canvas covers \
had been taken off the four rapid-fire guns on\\neach side of the doorway, \
and the ammunition-belts hung snakelike\\nfrom their breeches. A dun herd of \
armoured cars stood under the\\ntrees in the court-yard, engines going. The \
long, bare,\\ndimly-illuminated halls roared with the thunder of feet, \
calling,\\nshouting.... There was an atmosphere of recklessness. A crowd came\
\\npouring down the staircase, workers in black blouses and round black\\nfur \
hats, many of them with guns slung over their shoulders,\\nsoldiers in rough \
dirt-coloured coats and grey fur _shapki_ pinched\\nflat, a leader or \
so--Lunatcharsky, Kameniev--hurrying along in the\\ncentre of a group all \
talking at once, with harassed anxious faces,\\nand bulging portfolios under \
their arms. The extraordinary meeting\\nof the Petrograd Soviet was over. I \
stopped Kameniev--a quick moving\\nlittle man, with a wide, vivacious face \
set close to his shoulders.\\nWithout preface he read in rapid French a copy \
of the resolution\\njust passed:\\n\\nThe Petrograd Soviet of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, saluting\\nthe \
victorious Revolution of the Petrograd proletariat and \
garrison,\\nparticularly emphasises the unity, organisation, discipline, \
and\\ncomplete cooperation shown by the masses in this rising; rarely \
has\\nless blood been spilled, and rarely has an insurrection succeeded \
so\\nwell.\\n\\nThe Soviet expresses its firm conviction that the Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government which, as the \
government of the Soviets, will\\nbe created by the Revolution, and which \
will assure the industrial\\nproletariat of the support of the entire mass of \
poor peasants, will\\nmarch firmly toward Socialism, the only means by which \
the country\\ncan be spared the miseries and unheard-of horrors of \
war.\\n\\nThe new Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Government will propose immediately a\\njust and democratic peace to all the \
belligerent countries.\\n\\nIt will suppress immediately the great landed \
property, and transfer\\nthe land to the peasants. It will establish workmen\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s control over\\nproduction and distribution of \
manufactured products, and will set\\nup a general control over the banks, \
which it will transform into a\\nstate monopoly.\\n\\nThe Petrograd Soviet of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies calls \
upon\\nthe workers and the peasants of Russia to support with all \
their\\nenergy and all their devotion the Proletarian Revolution. The \
Soviet\\nexpresses its conviction that the city workers, allies of the \
poor\\npeasants, will assure complete revolutionary order, indispensable\\nto \
the victory of Socialism. The Soviet is convinced that the\\nproletariat of \
the countries of Western Europe will aid us in\\nconducting the cause of \
Socialism to a real and lasting victory.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You \
consider it won then?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe lifted his shoulders. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is much to do. Horribly much. It is\\njust \
beginning....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the landing I met Riazanov, \
vice-president of the Trade Unions,\\nlooking black and biting his grey \
beard. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s insane! Insane!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nshouted. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The European \
working-class won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t move! All Russia--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He\\nwaved his hand distractedly and ran off. \
Riazanov and Kameniev had\\nboth opposed the insurrection, and felt the lash \
of Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s terrible\\ntongue....\\n\\nIt had been a \
momentous session. In the name of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee \
Trotzky had declared that the Provisional\\nGovernment no longer \
existed.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The characteristic of bourgeois \
governments,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is \
to\\ndeceive the people. We, the Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, are \
going to try an experiment unique in\\nhistory; we are going to found a power \
which will have no other aim\\nbut to satisfy the needs of the soldiers, \
workers, and peasants.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nLenin had appeared, \
welcomed with a mighty ovation, prophesying\\nworld-wide Social \
Revolution.... And Zinoviev, crying, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This day \
we\\nhave paid our debt to the international proletariat, and struck \
a\\nterrible blow at the war, a terrible body-blow at all the\\nimperialists \
and particularly at Wilhelm the \
Executioner....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen Trotzky, that telegrams had \
been sent to the front announcing\\nthe victorious insurrection, but no reply \
had come. Troops were said\\nto be marching against Petrograd--a delegation \
must be sent to tell\\nthem the truth.\\n\\nCries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You \
are anticipating the will of the All-Russian Congress of\\nSoviets!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTrotzky, coldly, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
will of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets\\nhas been anticipated by the \
rising of the Petrograd workers \
and\\nsoldiers!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSo we came into the great \
meeting-hall, pushing through the\\nclamorous mob at the door. In the rows of \
seats, under the white\\nchandeliers, packed immovably in the aisles and on \
the sides,\\nperched on every window-sill, and even the edge of the platform, \
the\\nrepresentatives of the workers and soldiers of all Russia waited \
in\\nanxious silence or wild exultation the ringing of the chairman\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nbell. There was no heat in the hall but the stifling \
heat of\\nunwashed human bodies. A foul blue cloud of cigarette smoke \
rose\\nfrom the mass and hung in the thick air. Occasionally some one \
in\\nauthority mounted the tribune and asked the comrades not to \
smoke;\\nthen everybody, smokers and all, took up the cry \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t smoke,\\ncomrades!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and went on smoking. Petrovsky, Anarchist delegate \
from\\nthe Obukhov factory, made a seat for me beside him. Unshaven \
and\\nfilthy, he was reeling from three nights\[CloseCurlyQuote] sleepless \
work on the\\nMilitary Revolutionary Committee.\\n\\nOn the platform sat the \
leaders of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_--for the\\nlast time dominating the \
turbulent Soviets, which they had ruled\\nfrom the first days, and which were \
now risen against them. It was\\nthe end of the first period of the Russian \
revolution, which these\\nmen had attempted to guide in careful ways.... The \
three greatest of\\nthem were not there: Kerensky, flying to the front \
through country\\ntowns all doubtfully heaving up; Tcheidze, the old eagle, \
who had\\ncontemptuously retired to his own Georgian mountains, there \
to\\nsicken with consumption; and the high-souled Tseretelli, also\\nmortally \
stricken, who, nevertheless, would return and pour out his\\nbeautiful \
eloquence for a lost cause. Gotz sat there, Dan, Lieber,\\nBogdanov, Broido, \
Fillipovsky,--white-faced, hollow-eyed and\\nindignant. Below them the second \
_siezd_ of the All-Russian Soviets\\nboiled and swirled, and over their heads \
the Military Revolutionary\\nCommittee functioned white-hot, holding in its \
hands the threads of\\ninsurrection and striking with a long arm.... It was \
10.40 P. M.\\n\\nDan, a mild-faced, baldish figure in a shapeless military \
surgeon\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nuniform, was ringing the bell. Silence fell \
sharply, intense, broken\\nby the scuffling and disputing of the people at \
the door....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We have the power in our hands,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he began sadly, stopped for a\\nmoment, and then \
went on in a low voice. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! The Congress \
of\\nSoviets in meeting in such unusual circumstances and in such \
an\\nextraordinary moment that you will understand why the \
_Tsay-ee-kah_\\nconsiders it unnecessary to address you with a political \
speech.\\nThis will become much clearer to you if you will recollect that I \
am\\na member of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and that at this very moment our\\nparty \
comrades are in the Winter Palace under bombardment,\\nsacrificing themselves \
to execute the duty put on them by \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ (Confused uproar.)\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I declare the first session of the Second Congress of \
Soviets of\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies open!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe election of the presidium \
took place amid stir and moving about.\\nAvanessov announced that by \
agreement of the Bolsheviki, Left\\nSocialist Revolutionaries and Mensheviki \
Internationalists, it was\\ndecided to base the presidium upon \
proportionality. Several Mensheviki\\nleaped to their feet protesting. A \
bearded soldier shouted at them,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Remember what you \
did to us Bolsheviki when _we_ were the \
minority!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nResult--14 Bolsheviki, 7 Socialist \
Revolutionaries, 3 Mensheviki and\\n1 Internationalist (Gorky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s group). Hendelmann, for the right and\\ncentre Socialist \
Revolutionaries, said that they refused to take\\npart in the presidium; the \
same from Kintchuk, for the Mensheviki;\\nand from the Mensheviki \
Internationalists, that until the verification\\nof certain circumstances, \
they too could not enter the presidium.\\nScattering applause and hoots. One \
voice, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Renegades, you call\\nyourselves Socialists!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A representative of the Ukrainean \
delegates\\ndemanded, and received, a place. Then the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ \
stepped\\ndown, and in their places appeared Trotzky, Kameniev, Lunatcharsky,\
\\nMadame Kollentai, Nogin.... The hall rose, thundering. How far they\\nhad \
soared, these Bolsheviki, from a despised and hunted sect less\\nthan four \
months ago, to this supreme place, the helm of great Russia\\nin full tide of \
insurrection!\\n\\nThe order of the day, said Kameniev, was first, \
Organisation of\\nPower; second, War and Peace; and third, the Constituent \
Assembly.\\nLozovsky, rising, announced that upon agreement of the bureau of \
all\\nfactions, it was proposed to hear and discuss the report of \
the\\nPetrograd Soviet, then to give the floor to members of \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ and the different parties, and finally to pass to \
the\\norder of the day.\\n\\nBut suddenly a new sound made itself heard, \
deeper than the tumult\\nof the crowd, persistent, disquieting,--the dull \
shock of guns.\\nPeople looked anxiously toward the clouded windows, and a \
sort of\\nfever came over them. Martov, demanding the floor, croaked \
hoarsely,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The civil war is beginning, comrades! The \
first question must be a\\npeaceful settlement of the crisis. On principle \
and from a political\\nstandpoint we must urgently discuss a means of \
averting civil war.\\nOur brothers are being shot down in the streets! At \
this moment,\\nwhen before the opening of the Congress of Soviets the \
question of\\nPower is being settled by means of a military plot organised by \
one\\nof the revolutionary parties--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] for a moment he \
could not make\\nhimself heard above the noise, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All of \
the revolutionary parties\\nmust face the fact! The first _vopros_ (question) \
before the\\nCongress is the question of Power, and this question is \
already\\nbeing settled by force of arms in the streets!... We must create \
a\\npower which will be recognised by the whole democracy. If the\\nCongress \
wishes to be the voice of the revolutionary democracy it\\nmust not sit with \
folded hands before the developing civil war, the\\nresult of which may be a \
dangerous outburst of counter-revolution....\\nThe possibility of a peaceful \
outcome lies in the formation of a\\nunited democratic authority.... We must \
elect a delegation to\\nnegotiate with the other Socialist parties and \
organisation....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAlways the methodical muffled \
boom of cannon through the windows,\\nand the delegates, screaming at each \
other.... So, with the crash of\\nartillery, in the dark, with hatred, and \
fear, and reckless daring,\\nnew Russia was being born.\\n\\nThe Left \
Socialist Revolutionaries and the United Social Democrats\\nsupported Martov\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proposition. It was accepted. A soldier announced\\nthat \
the All-Russian Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets had refused to send \
delegates\\nto the Congress; he proposed that a committee be sent with a \
formal\\ninvitation. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Some delegates are present,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I move that \
they\\nbe given votes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Accepted.\\n\\nKharash, \
wearing the epaulets of a captain, passionately demanded\\nthe floor. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The political hypocrites who control this Congress,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nshouted, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]told us we were \
to settle the question of Power--and it is\\nbeing settled behind our backs, \
before the Congress opens! Blows are\\nbeing struck against the Winter \
Palace, and it is by such blows that\\nthe nails are being driven into the \
coffin of the political party\\nwhich has risked such an adventure!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Uproar. Followed him Gharra:\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]While we are here discussing propositions of peace, \
there is a\\nbattle on in the streets.... The Socialist Revolutionaries and \
the\\nMensheviki refuse to be involved in what is happening, and call \
upon\\nall public forces to resist the attempt to capture the power....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nKutchin, delegate of the 12th Army and \
representative of the\\nTroudoviki: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I was sent here \
only for information, and I am\\nreturning at once to the Front, where all \
the Army Committees\\nconsider that the taking of power by the Soviets, only \
three weeks\\nbefore the Constituent Assembly, is a stab in the back of the \
Army\\nand a crime against the people--!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Shouts of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Lie! You lie!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... When \
he\\ncould be heard again, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s make \
an end of this adventure in\\nPetrograd! I call upon all delegates to leave \
this hall in order to\\nsave the country and the Revolution!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] As he went down the aisle in\\nthe midst of a \
deafening noise, people surged in upon him,\\nthreatening.... Then Khintchuk, \
an officer with a long brown goatee,\\nspeaking suavely and persuasively: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I speak for the delegates from\\nthe Front. The Army \
is imperfectly represented in this Congress, and\\nfurthermore, the Army does \
not consider the Congress of Soviets\\nnecessary at this time, only three \
weeks before the opening of the\\nConstituent--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
shouts and stamping, always growing more violent. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The\\nArmy does not consider that the Congress of \
Soviets has the\\nnecessary authority--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Soldiers \
began to stand up all over the hall.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you \
speaking for? What do you represent?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they \
cried.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Central Executive Committee of the \
Soviet of the Fifth Army,\\nthe Second F-- regiment, the First N-- Regiment, \
the Third S-- \
Rifles....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When were you \
elected? You represent the officers, not the\\nsoldiers! What do the soldiers \
say about it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Jeers and hoots.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We, the Front group, disclaim all responsibility for \
what has\\nhappened and is happening, and we consider it necessary to \
mobilise\\nall self-conscious revolutionary forces for the salvation of \
the\\nRevolution! The Front group will leave the Congress.... The place \
to\\nfight is out on the streets!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nImmense \
bawling outcry. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You speak for the Staff--not for the \
Army!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I appeal to all \
reasonable soldiers to leave this Congress!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilovitz! Counter-revolutionist! Provocator!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] were hurled at him.\\n\\nOn behalf of the \
Mensheviki, Khintchuk then announced that the only\\npossibility of a \
peaceful solution was to begin negotiations with\\nthe Provisional Government \
for the formation of a new Cabinet, which\\nwould find support in all strata \
of society. He could not proceed\\nfor several minutes. Raising his voice to \
a shout he read the\\nMenshevik \
declaration:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Because the Bolsheviki have made a \
military conspiracy with the aid\\nof the Petrograd Soviet, without \
consulting the other factions and\\nparties, we find it impossible to remain \
in the Congress, and\\ntherefore withdraw, inviting the other groups to \
follow us and to\\nmeet for discussion of the situation!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Deserter!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At intervals in the almost continuous \
disturbance\\nHendelman, for the Socialist Revolutionaries, could be \
heard\\nprotesting against the bombardment of the Winter Palace.... \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are\\nopposed to this kind of anarchy....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nScarcely had he stepped down than a young, \
lean-faced soldier, with\\nflashing eyes, leaped to the platform, and \
dramatically lifted his\\nhand:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried and there was a hush. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]My _familia_ (name) is\\nPeterson--I speak for the \
Second Lettish Rifles. You have heard the\\nstatements of two representatives \
of the Army committees; these\\nstatements would have some value _if their \
authors had been\\nrepresentatives of the Army_--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Wild applause. _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But they do not\\nrepresent the \
soldiers!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ Shaking his fist. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Twelfth Army has\\nbeen insisting for a long time \
upon the re-election of the Great\\nSoviet and the Army Committee, but just \
as your own _Tsay-ee-kah,_\\nour Committee refused to call a meeting of the \
representatives of\\nthe masses until the end of September, so that the \
reactionaries\\ncould elect their own false delegates to this Congress. I \
tell you\\nnow, the Lettish soldiers have many times said, \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]No more\\nresolutions! No more talk! We want deeds--the \
Power must be in our\\nhands!\[CloseCurlyQuote] Let these impostor delegates \
leave the Congress! The Army is\\nnot with \
them!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe hall rocked with cheering. In the \
first moments of the session,\\nstunned by the rapidity of events, startled \
by the sound of cannon,\\nthe delegates had hesitated. For an hour \
hammer-blow after\\nhammer-blow had fallen from that tribune, welding them \
together but\\nbeating them down. Did they stand then alone? Was Russia \
rising\\nagainst them? Was it true that the Army was marching on \
Petrograd?\\nThen this clear-eyed young soldier had spoken, and in a flash \
they\\nknew it for the truth.... _This_ was the voice of the \
soldiers--the\\nstirring millions of uniformed workers and peasants were men \
like\\nthem, and their thoughts and feelings were the same...\\n\\nMore \
soldiers ... Gzhelshakh; for the Front delegates, announcing that\\nthey had \
only decided to leave the Congress by a small majority, and\\nthat _the \
Bolshevik members had not even taken part in the vote,_ as\\nthey stood for \
division according to political parties, and not\\ngroups. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Hundreds of delegates from the Front,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]are being\\nelected \
without the participation of the soldiers because the Army\\nCommittees are \
no longer the real representatives of the rank and\\nfile....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Lukianov, crying that officers like Kharash and \
Khintchuk\\ncould not represent the Army in this congress,--but only the high\
\\ncommand. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The real inhabitants of the trenches want \
with all their\\nhearts the transfer of Power into the hands of the Soviets, \
and they\\nexpect very much from it!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... The tide was \
turning.\\n\\nThen came Abramovitch, for the _Bund,_ the organ of the \
Jewish\\nSocial Democrats--his eyes snapping behind thick glasses, \
trembling\\nwith rage.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What is taking place now \
in Petrograd is a monstrous calamity! The\\n_Bund_ group joins with the \
declaration of the Mensheviki and\\nSocialist Revolutionaries and will leave \
the Congress!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He raised\\nhis voice and hand. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our duty to the Russian proletariat doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\npermit us to remain here and be responsible for these \
crimes.\\nBecause the firing on the Winter Palace doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
cease, the Municipal\\nDuma together with the Mensheviki and Socialist \
Revolutionaries, and\\nthe Executive Committee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviet, has decided to\\nperish with the Provisional \
Government, and we are going with them!\\nUnarmed we will expose our breasts \
to the machine guns of the\\nTerrorists.... We invite all delegates to this \
Congress--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The rest was\\nlost in a storm of hoots, \
menaces and curses which rose to a hellish\\npitch as fifty delegates got up \
and pushed their way out....\\n\\nKameniev jangled the bell, shouting, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Keep your seats and we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll go\\non \
with our business!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] And Trotzky, standing up with a \
pale, cruel\\nface, letting out his rich voice in cool contempt, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All these\\nso-called Socialist compromisers, these \
frightened Mensheviki,\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, _Bund_--let them go! They \
are just so much\\nrefuse which will be swept into the garbage-heap of \
history!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nRiazanov, for the Bolsheviki, stated \
that at the request of the City\\nDuma the Military Revolutionary Committee \
had sent a delegation to\\noffer negotiations to the Winter Palace. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In this way we have done\\neverything possible to \
avoid blood-shed....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe hurried from the place, \
stopping for a moment at the room where\\nthe Military Revolutionary \
Committee worked at furious speed,\\nengulfing and spitting out panting \
couriers, despatching Commissars\\narmed with power of life and death to all \
the corners of the city,\\namid the buzz of the telephonographs. The door \
opened, a blast of\\nstale air and cigarette smoke rushed out, we caught a \
glimpse of\\ndishevelled men bending over a map under the glare of a \
shaded\\nelectric-light.... Comrade Josephov-Dukhvinski, a smiling youth with \
a\\nmop of pale yellow hair, made out passes for us.\\n\\nWhen we came into \
the chill night, all the front of Smolny was one\\nhuge park of arriving and \
departing automobiles, above the sound of\\nwhich could be heard the far-off \
slow beat of the cannon. A great\\nmotor-truck stood there, shaking to the \
roar of its engine. Men were\\ntossing bundles into it, and others receiving \
them, with guns beside\\nthem.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where are you \
going?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I \
shouted.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Down-town--all over--everywhere!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered a little workman,\\ngrinning, with a large \
exultant gesture.\\n\\nWe showed our passes. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Come \
along!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they invited. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But there\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll\\nprobably be shooting--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] We \
climbed in; the clutch slid home with a\\nraking jar, the great car jerked \
forward, we all toppled backward on\\ntop of those who were climbing in; past \
the huge fire by the gate,\\nand then the fire by the outer gate, glowing red \
on the faces of the\\nworkmen with rifles who squatted around it, and went \
bumping at top\\nspeed down the Suvorovsky Prospect, swaying from side to \
side.... One\\nman tore the wrapping from a bundle and began to hurl handfuls \
of\\npapers into the air. We imitated him, plunging down through the \
dark\\nstreet with a tail of white papers floating and eddying out \
behind.\\nThe late passerby stooped to pick them up; the patrols \
around\\nbonfires on the corners ran out with uplifted arms to catch \
them.\\nSometimes armed men loomed up ahead, crying \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Shtoi!_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and raising\\ntheir \
guns, but our chauffeur only yelled something unintelligible\\nand we hurtled \
on....\\n\\nI picked up a copy of the paper, and under a fleeting \
street-light\\nread:\\n\\nTO THE CITIZENS OF RUSSIA!\\n\\nThe Provisional \
Government is deposed. The State Power has passed\\ninto the hands of the \
organ of the Petrograd Soviet of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nSoldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, the Military Revolutionary Committee, \
which\\nstands at the head of the Petrograd proletariat and \
garrison.\\n\\nThe cause for which the people were fighting: immediate \
proposal of\\na democratic peace, abolition of landlord property-rights over \
the\\nland, labor control over production, creation of a \
Soviet\\nGovernment--that cause is securely achieved.\\n\\nLONG LIVE THE \
REVOLUTION OF WORKMEN, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS!\\n\\n_Military Revolutionary \
Committee_\\n\\n_Petrograd Soviet of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies._\\n\\n[Graphic, page 96: Proclamation in \
Russian, title follows]\\n\\nProclamation of the Fall of the Provisional \
Government issued by the\\nMilitary Revolutionary Committee on the night of \
November 7th (our\\ncalendar), which we helped to distribute from a \
motor-truck just\\nafter the surrender of the Winter Palace.\\n\\nA \
slant-eyed, Mongolian-faced man who sat beside me, dressed in a\\ngoat-skin \
Caucasian cape, snapped, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Look out! Here the \
provocators\\nalways shoot from the windows!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] We \
turned into Znamensky Square,\\ndark and almost deserted, careened around \
Trubetskoy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s brutal statue\\nand swung down the wide Nevsky, \
three men standing up with rifles\\nready, peering at the windows. Behind us \
the street was alive with\\npeople running and stooping. We could no longer \
hear the cannon, and\\nthe nearer we drew to the Winter Palace end of the \
city the quieter\\nand more deserted were the streets. The City Duma was all \
brightly\\nlighted. Beyond that we made out a dark mass of people, and a line\
\\nof sailors, who yelled furiously at us to stop. The machine slowed\\ndown, \
and we climbed out.\\n\\nIt was an astonishing scene. Just at the corner of \
the Ekaterina\\nCanal, under an arc-light, a cordon of armed sailors was \
drawn\\nacross the Nevsky, blocking the way to a crowd of people in \
column\\nof fours. There were about three or four hundred of them, men \
in\\nfrock coats, well-dressed women, officers--all sorts and conditions\\nof \
people. Among them we recognised many of the delegates from the\\nCongress, \
leaders of the Mensheviki and Socialist Revolutionaries;\\nAvksentiev, the \
lean, red-bearded president of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSoviets, \
Sarokin, Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s spokesman, Khintchuk, Abramovitch; \
and\\nat the head white-bearded old Schreider, Mayor of Petrograd, \
and\\nProkopovitch, Minister of Supplies in the Provisional \
Government,\\narrested that morning and released. I caught sight of \
Malkin,\\nreporter for the _Russian Daily News._ \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Going \
to die in the Winter\\nPalace,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he shouted cheerfully. \
The procession stood still, but from\\nthe front of it came loud argument. \
Schreider and Prokopovitch were\\nbellowing at the big sailor who seemed in \
command.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We demand to pass!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See, these \
comrades come from the\\nCongress of Soviets! Look at their tickets! We are \
going to the\\nWinter Palace!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe sailor was \
plainly puzzled. He scratched his head with an\\nenormous hand, frowning. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have orders from the Committee not to\\nlet anybody \
go to the Winter Palace,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he grumbled. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But I will send\\na comrade to telephone to Smolny....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We Insist upon passing! \
We are unarmed! We will march on whether\\nyou permit us or not!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried old Schreider, very much excited.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have orders--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] repeated the \
sailor sullenly.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shoot us if you want to! We will \
pass! Forward!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] came from all\\nsides. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are ready to die, if you have the heart to fire \
on\\nRussians and comrades! We bare our breasts to your guns!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the sailor, looking stubborn, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t allow you to pass.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What will you do if we \
go forward? Will you shoot?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not going to shoot people who \
haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t any guns. We won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nshoot unarmed \
Russian people....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
will go forward! What can you do?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will do something,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] replied \
the sailor, evidently at a loss. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We\\ncan\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let you pass. We will do something.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What will you do? What \
will you do?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAnother sailor came up, very much \
irritated. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will spank you!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he\\ncried, energetically. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And if necessary we will \
shoot you too. Go\\nhome now, and leave us in \
peace!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt this there was a great clamour of \
anger and resentment,\\nProkopovitch had mounted some sort of box, and, \
waving his umbrella,\\nhe made a speech:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades \
and citizens!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Force \
is being used against us!\\nWe cannot have our innocent blood upon the hands \
of these ignorant\\nmen! It is beneath our dignity to be shot down here in \
the street by\\nswitchmen--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (What he meant by \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]switchmen\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I never discovered.) \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let\\nus return to the Duma and discuss the best means \
of saving the\\ncountry and the \
Revolution!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWhereupon, in dignified silence, the \
procession marched around and\\nback up the Nevsky, always in column of \
fours. And taking advantage\\nof the diversion we slipped past the guards and \
set off in the\\ndirection of the Winter Palace.\\n\\nHere it was absolutely \
dark, and nothing moved but pickets of\\nsoldiers and Red Guards grimly \
intent. In front of the Kazan\\nCathedral a three-inch field-gun lay in the \
middle of the street,\\nslewed sideways from the recoil of its last shot over \
the roofs.\\nSoldiers were standing in every doorway talking in low tones and\
\\npeering down toward the Police Bridge. I heard one voice saying: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\\nis possible that we have done wrong....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At the corners patrols\\nstopped all passersby--and \
the composition of these patrols was\\ninteresting, for in command of the \
regular troops was invariably a\\nRed Guard.... The shooting had \
ceased.\\n\\nJust as we came to the Morskaya somebody was shouting: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The\\n_yunkers_ have sent word they want us to go and \
get them out!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nVoices began to give commands, and in \
the thick gloom we made out a\\ndark mass moving forward, silent but for the \
shuffle of feet and the\\nclinking of arms. We fell in with the first \
ranks.\\n\\nLike a black river, filling all the street, without song or cheer \
we\\npoured through the Red Arch, where the man just ahead of me said in\\na \
low voice: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Look out, comrades! Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
trust them. They will fire,\\nsurely!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In the open we \
began to run, stooping low and bunching\\ntogether, and jammed up suddenly \
behind the pedestal of the\\nAlexander \
Column.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How many of you did they kill?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know. About ten....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAfter a \
few minutes huddling there, some hundreds of men, the army\\nseemed reassured \
and without any orders suddenly began again to flow\\nforward. By this time, \
in the light that streamed out of all the\\nWinter Palace windows, I could \
see that the first two or three\\nhundred men were Red Guards, with only a \
few scattered soldiers.\\nOver the barricade of firewood we clambered, and \
leaping down inside\\ngave a triumphant shout as we stumbled on a heap of \
rifles thrown\\ndown by the _yunkers_ who had stood there. On both sides of \
the main\\ngateway the doors stood wide open, light streamed out, and from \
the\\nhuge pile came not the slightest sound.\\n\\nCarried along by the eager \
wave of men we were swept into the right\\nhand entrance, opening into a \
great bare vaulted room, the cellar of\\nthe East wing, from which issued a \
maze of corridors and\\nstair-cases. A number of huge packing cases stood \
about, and upon\\nthese the Red Guards and soldiers fell furiously, battering \
them\\nopen with the butts of their rifles, and pulling out \
carpets,\\ncurtains, linen, porcelain plates, glassware.... One man \
went\\nstrutting around with a bronze clock perched on his \
shoulder;\\nanother found a plume of ostrich feathers, which he stuck in \
his\\nhat. The looting was just beginning when somebody cried, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades!\\nDon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t touch anything! Don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t take anything! This is the property of\\nthe People!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Immediately twenty voices were crying, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Stop! Put\\neverything back! Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
take anything! Property of the People!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Many\\nhands \
dragged the spoilers down. Damask and tapestry were snatched\\nfrom the arms \
of those who had them; two men took away the bronze\\nclock. Roughly and \
hastily the things were crammed back in their\\ncases, and self-appointed \
sentinels stood guard. It was all utterly\\nspontaneous. Through corridors \
and up stair-cases the cry could be\\nheard growing fainter and fainter in \
the distance, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Revolutionary\\ndiscipline! Property of \
the People....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe crossed back over to the left \
entrance, in the West wing. There\\norder was also being established. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Clear the Palace!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] bawled a Red\
\\nGuard, sticking his head through an inner door. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Come, comrades,\\nlet\[CloseCurlyQuote]s show that we\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]re not thieves and bandits. Everybody out of the\\nPalace \
except the Commissars, until we get sentries \
posted.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTwo Red Guards, a soldier and an \
officer, stood with revolvers in\\ntheir hands. Another soldier sat at a \
table behind them, with pen\\nand paper. Shouts of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All \
out! All out!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] were heard far and near\\nwithin, and \
the Army began to pour through the door, jostling,\\nexpostulating, arguing. \
As each man appeared he was seized by the\\nself-appointed committee, who \
went through his pockets and looked\\nunder his coat. Everything that was \
plainly not his property was\\ntaken away, the man at the table noted it on \
his paper, and it was\\ncarried into a little room. The most amazing \
assortment of objects\\nwere thus confiscated; statuettes, bottles of ink, \
bed-spreads\\nworked with the Imperial monogram, candles, a small \
oil-painting,\\ndesk blotters, gold-handled swords, cakes of soap, clothes of \
every\\ndescription, blankets. One Red Guard carried three rifles, two \
of\\nwhich he had taken away from _yunkers;_ another had four \
portfolios\\nbulging with written documents. The culprits either \
sullenly\\nsurrendered or pleaded like children. All talking at once \
the\\ncommittee explained that stealing was not worthy of the people\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nchampions; often those who had been caught turned \
around and began\\nto help go through the rest of the comrades. (See App. IV, \
Sect. 3)\\n\\n_Yunkers_ came out, in bunches of three or four. The \
committee\\nseized upon them with an excess of zeal, accompanying \
the\\nsearch with remarks like, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah, Provocators! \
Kornilovists!\\nCounter-revolutionists! Murderers of the People!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] But there was no\\nviolence done, although the \
_yunkers_ were terrified. They too had\\ntheir pockets full of small plunder. \
It was carefully noted down by\\nthe scribe, and piled in the little room.... \
The _yunkers_ were\\ndisarmed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now, will you take up \
arms against the People any more?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\ndemanded \
clamouring voices.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
answered the _yunkers,_ one by one. Whereupon they were\\nallowed to go free.\
\\n\\nWe asked if we might go inside. The committee was doubtful, but \
the\\nbig Red Guard answered firmly that it was forbidden. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you\\nanyway?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
asked. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How do I know that you are not all \
Kerenskys?\\n(There were five of us, two \
women.)\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Pazhal\[CloseCurlyQuote]st\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], touarishtchi!_ Way, Comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A \
soldier and a Red\\nGuard appeared in the door, waving the crowd aside, and \
other guards\\nwith fixed bayonets. After them followed single file half a \
dozen\\nmen in civilian dress--the members of the Provisional \
Government.\\nFirst came Kishkin, his face drawn and pale, then Rutenberg, \
looking\\nsullenly at the floor; Terestchenko was next, glancing \
sharply\\naround; he stared at us with cold fixity.... They passed in \
silence;\\nthe victorious insurrectionists crowded to see, but there were \
only\\na few angry mutterings. It was only later that we learned how \
the\\npeople in the street wanted to lynch them, and shots were \
fired--but\\nthe sailors brought them safely to Peter-Paul....\\n\\nIn the \
meanwhile unrebuked we walked into the Palace. There was\\nstill a great deal \
of coming and going, of exploring new-found\\napartments in the vast edifice, \
of searching for hidden garrisons of\\n_yunkers_ which did not exist. We went \
upstairs and wandered through\\nroom after room. This part of the Palace had \
been entered also by\\nother detachments from the side of the Neva. The \
paintings, statues,\\ntapestries and rugs of the great state apartments were \
unharmed; in\\nthe offices, however, every desk and cabinet had been \
ransacked, the\\npapers scattered over the floor, and in the living rooms \
beds had\\nbeen stripped of their coverings and ward-robes wrenched open. The\
\\nmost highly prized loot was clothing, which the working people\\nneeded. \
In a room where furniture was stored we came upon two\\nsoldiers ripping the \
elaborate Spanish leather upholstery from\\nchairs. They explained it was to \
make boots with....\\n\\nThe old Palace servants in their blue and red and \
gold uniforms\\nstood nervously about, from force of habit repeating, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t go\\nin there, _barin!_ It \
is forbidden--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] We penetrated at length to the\\ngold \
and malachite chamber with crimson brocade hangings where the\\nMinisters had \
been in session all that day and night, and where the\\n_shveitzari_ had \
betrayed them to the Red Guards. The long table\\ncovered with green baize \
was just as they had left it, under arrest.\\nBefore each empty seat was pen \
and ink and paper; the papers were\\nscribbled over with beginnings of plans \
of action, rough drafts of\\nproclamations and manifestos. Most of these were \
scratched out, as\\ntheir futility became evident, and the rest of the sheet \
covered\\nwith absent-minded geometrical designs, as the writers \
sat\\ndespondently listening while Minister after Minister \
proposed\\nchimerical schemes. I took one of these scribbled pages, in the \
hand\\nwriting of Konovalov, which read, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
Provisional Government\\nappeals to all classes to support the Provisional \
Government--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAll this time, it must be \
remembered, although the Winter Palace was\\nsurrounded, the Government was \
in constant communication with the\\nFront and with provincial Russia. The \
Bolsheviki had captured the\\nMinistry of War early in the morning, but they \
did not know of the\\nmilitary telegraph office in the attic, nor of the \
private telephone\\nline connecting it with the Winter Palace. In that attic \
a young\\nofficer sat all day, pouring out over the country a flood of \
appeals\\nand proclamations; and when he heard that the Palace had fallen, \
put\\non his hat and walked calmly out of the building....\\n\\nInterested as \
we were, for a considerable time we didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t notice a\\nchange \
in the attitude of the soldiers and Red Guards around us. As\\nwe strolled \
from room to room a small group followed us, until by\\nthe time we reached \
the great picture-gallery where we had spent the\\nafternoon with the \
_yunkers,_ about a hundred men surged in after\\nus. One giant of a soldier \
stood in our path, his face dark with\\nsullen suspicion.\\n\\n[Graphic, page \
104: Doodling by Konavalov, title follows]\\n\\nFacsimile of the beginning of \
a proclamation, written in pencil by\\nA.I. Konovalov, Minister of Commerce \
and Industry in he Provisional\\nGovernment, and then scratched out as the \
hopelessness of the\\nsituation became more and more evident. The geometrical \
figure\\nbeneath was probably idly drawn while the Ministers were waiting for\
\\nthe end.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he growled. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What are you doing here?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The others\\nmassed slowly around, staring and \
beginning to mutter.\\n_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Provocatori!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ I heard somebody say. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Looters!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I produced \
our\\npasses from the Military Revolutionary Committee. The soldier \
took\\nthem gingerly, turned them upside down and looked at them \
without\\ncomprehension. Evidently he could not read. He handed them back and\
\\nspat on the floor. _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bumagi!_ Papers!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he with contempt. The\\nmass slowly began to \
close in, like wild cattle around a cowpuncher\\non foot. Over their heads I \
caught sight of an officer, looking\\nhelpless, and shouted to him. He made \
for us, shouldering his way\\nthrough.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m the Commissar,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said to me. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you? What is it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
The\\nothers held back, waiting. I produced the papers.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are foreigners?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he rapidly \
asked in Franch. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is very\\ndangerous....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Then he turned to the mob, holding up our documents.\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These people are foreign comrades--from\\nAmerica. \
They have come here to be able to tell their countrymen\\nabout the bravery \
and the revolutionary discipline of the\\nproletarian army!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How do you know that?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] replied the big soldier. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I \
tell you they\\nare provocators! They say they came here to observe \
the\\nrevolutionary discipline of the proletarian army, but they have \
been\\nwandering freely through the Palace, and how do we know they haven\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\ngot their pockets full of loot?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\\n\\n_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Pravilno!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ snarled the \
others, pressing forward.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! Comrades!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] appealed the officer, sweat standing out on\\nhis \
forehead. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am Commissar of the Military Revolutionary\
\\nCommittee. Do you trust me? Well, I tell you that these passes \
are\\nsigned with the same names that are signed to my pass!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe led us down through the Palace and out \
through a door opening\\nonto the Neva quay, before which stood the usual \
committee going\\nthrough pockets... \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You have narrowly \
escaped,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he kept muttering,\\nwiping his face.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What happened to the Women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Battalion?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] we \
asked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh--the women!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He \
laughed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They were all huddled up in a back\\nroom. We \
had a terrible time deciding what to do with them--many were\\nin hysterics, \
and so on. So finally we marched them up to the\\nFinland Station and put \
them on a train for Levashovo, where they\\nhave a camp. (See App. IV, Sect. \
4)....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe came out into the cold, nervous night, \
murmurous with obscure\\narmies on the move, electric with patrols. From \
across the river,\\nwhere loomed the darker mass of Peter-Paul, came a hoarse \
shout....\\nUnderfoot the sidewalk was littered with broken stucco, from \
the\\ncornice of the Palace where two shells from the battleship \
_Avrora_\\nhad struck; that was the only damage done by the \
bombardment....\\n\\nIt was now after three in the morning. On the Nevsky all \
the\\nstreet-lights were again shining, the cannon gone, and the only\\nsigns \
of war were Red Guards and soldiers squatting around fires.\\nThe city was \
quiet--probably never so quiet in its history; on that\\nnight not a single \
hold-up occurred, not a single robbery.\\n\\nBut the City Duma Building was \
all illuminated. We mounted to the\\ngalleried Alexander Hall, hung with its \
great, gold-framed,\\nred-shrouded Imperial portraits. About a hundred people \
were grouped\\naround the platform, where Skobeliev was speaking. He urged \
that the\\nCommittee of Public Safety be expanded, so as to unite all \
the\\nanti-Bolshevik elements in one huge organisation, to be called \
the\\nCommittee for Salvation of Country and Revolution. And as we \
looked\\non, the Committee for Salvation was formed--that Committee which was\
\\nto develop into the most powerful enemy of the Bolsheviki,\\nappearing, in \
the next week, sometimes under its own partisan name,\\nand sometimes as the \
strictly non-partisan Committee of Public\\nSafety....\\n\\nDan, Gotz, \
Avkesntiev were there, some of the insurgent Soviet\\ndelegates, members of \
the Executive Committee of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSoviets, old \
Prokopovitch, and even members of the Council of the\\nRepublic--among whom \
Vinaver and other Cadets. Lieber cried that the\\nconvention of Soviets was \
not a legal convention, that the old\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ was still in office.... \
An appeal to the country was\\ndrafted.\\n\\nWe hailed a cab. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where to?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] But when we said \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Smolny,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the\\n_izvoshtchik_ \
shook his head. _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Niet!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ said \
he, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]there are\\ndevils....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It \
was only after weary wandering that we found a driver\\nwilling to take \
us--and he wanted thirty rubles, and stopped two\\nblocks away.\\n\\nThe \
windows of Smolny were still ablaze, motors came and went, and\\naround the \
still-leaping fires the sentries huddled close, eagerly\\nasking everybody \
the latest news. The corridors were full of\\nhurrying men, hollow-eyed and \
dirty. In some of the committee-rooms\\npeople lay sleeping on the floor, \
their guns beside them. In spite\\nof the seceding delegates, the hall of \
meetings was crowded with\\npeople, roaring like the sea. As we came in, \
Kameniev was reading\\nthe list of arrested Ministers. The name of \
Terestchenko was greeted\\nwith thunderous applause, shouts of satisfaction, \
laughter;\\nRutenburg came in for less; and at the mention of Paltchinsky, \
a\\nstorm of hoots, angry cries, cheers burst forth.... It was \
announced\\nthat Tchudnovsky had been appointed Commissar of the Winter \
Palace.\\n\\nNow occurred a dramatic interruption. A big peasant, his bearded\
\\nface convulsed with rage, mounted the platform and pounded with his\\nfist \
on the presidium table.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We, Socialist \
Revolutionaries, insist upon the immediate release of\\nthe Socialist \
Ministers arrested in the Winter Palace! Comrades! Do\\nyou know that four \
comrades who risked their lives and their freedom\\nfighting against tyranny \
of the Tsar, have been flung into\\nPeter-Paul prison--the historical tomb of \
Liberty?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In the uproar he\\npounded and yelled. \
Another delegate climbed up beside him, and\\npointed at the presidium.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are the representatives of the revolutionary masses \
going to sit\\nquietly here while the _Okhrana_ of the Bolsheviki tortures \
their\\nleaders?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTrotzky was gesturing for \
silence. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These \[OpenCurlyQuote]comrades\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] who are now\\ncaught plotting the crushing of the Soviets \
with the adventurer\\nKerensky--is there any reason to handle them with \
gloves? After July\\n16th and 18th they didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t use much \
ceremony with us!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] With a\\ntriumphant ring in his \
voice he cried, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now that the _oborontsi_ and\\nthe \
faint-hearted have gone, and the whole task of defending and\\nsaving the \
Revolution rests on our shoulders, it is particularly\\nnecessary to \
work--work--work! We have decided to die rather than give\\nup!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFollowed him a Commissar from Tsarskoye Selo, \
panting and covered\\nwith the mud of his ride. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
garrison of Tsarskoye Selo is on\\nguard at the gates of Petrograd, ready to \
defend the Soviets and the\\nMilitary Revolutionary Committee!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Wild cheers. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Cycle \
Corps\\nsent from the front has arrived at Tsarskoye, and the soldiers \
are\\nnow with us; they recognise the power of the Soviets, the \
necessity\\nof immediate transfer of land to the peasants and industrial \
control\\nto the workers. The Fifth Battalion of Cyclists, stationed \
at\\nTsarskoye, is ours....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen the delegate of \
the Third Cycle Battalion. In the midst of\\ndelirious enthusiasm he told how \
the cycle corps had been ordered\\n_three days before_ from the South-west \
front to the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]defence of\\nPetrograd.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] They suspected, however, the meaning of the order; \
and\\nat the station of Peredolsk were met by representatives of the \
Fifth\\nBattalion from Tsarskoye. A joint meeting was held, and it \
was\\ndiscovered that \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]among the cyclists not a single \
man was found\\nwilling to shed the blood of his brothers, or to support \
a\\nGovernment of bourgeois and \
land-owners!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nKapelinski, for the Mensheviki \
Internationalists, proposed to elect\\na special committee to find a peaceful \
solution to the civil war.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t any peaceful solution!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] bellowed \
the crowed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Victory\\nis the only solution!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The vote was overwhelmingly against, and \
the\\nMensheviki Internationalists left the Congress in a Whirlwind \
of\\nJocular insults. There was no longer any panic fear.... Kameniev \
from\\nthe platform shouted after them, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Mensheviki \
Internationalists\\nclaimed \[OpenCurlyQuote]emergency\[CloseCurlyQuote] for \
the question of a \[OpenCurlyQuote]peaceful solution,\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
but\\nthey always voted for suspension of the order of the day in favour\\nof \
declarations of factions which wanted to leave the Congress. It\\nis evident,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] finished Kameniev, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that the \
withdrawal of all these\\nrenegades was decided upon beforehand!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe assembly decided to ignore the withdrawal \
of the factions, and\\nproceed to the appeal to the workers, soldiers and \
peasants of all\\nRussia:\\n\\nTO WORKERS, SOLDIERS AND PEASANTS\\n\\nThe \
Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies has opened. It represents the great \
majority of the\\nSoviets. There are also a number of Peasant deputies. Based \
upon the\\nwill of the great majority of the workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], \
soldiers and peasants,\\nbased upon the triumphant uprising of the Petrograd \
workmen and\\nsoldiers, the Congress assumes the Power.\\n\\nThe Provisional \
Government is deposed. Most of the members of the\\nProvisional Government \
are already arrested.\\n\\nThe Soviet authority will at once propose an \
immediate democratic\\npeace to all nations, and an immediate truce on all \
fronts. It will\\nassure the free transfer of landlord, crown and monastery \
lands to\\nthe Land Committees, defend the soldiers rights, enforcing \
a\\ncomplete democratisation of the Army, establish workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
control\\nover production, ensure the convocation of the Constituent Assembly\
\\nat the proper date, take means to supply bread to the cities \
and\\narticles of first necessity to the villages, and secure to \
all\\nnationalities living in Russia a real right to independent \
existence.\\n\\nThe Congress resolves: that all local power shall be \
transferred to\\nthe Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, which\\nmust \
enforce revolutionary order.\\n\\nThe Congress calls upon the soldiers in the \
trenches to be watchful\\nand steadfast. The Congress of Soviets is sure that \
the\\nrevolutionary Army will know how to defend the Revolution against\\nall \
attacks of Imperialism, until the new Government shall have\\nbrought about \
the conclusion of the democratic peace which it will\\ndirectly propose to \
all nations. The new Government will take all\\nnecessary steps to secure \
everything needful to the revolutionary\\nArmy, by means of a determined \
policy of requisition and taxation of\\nthe propertied classes, and also to \
improve the situation of\\nsoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] families.\\n\\nThe \
Kornilovitz-Kerensky, Kaledin and others, are endeavouring to\\nlead troops \
against Petrograd. Several regiments, deceived by\\nKerensky, have sided with \
the insurgent People.\\n\\nSoldiers! Make active resistance to the \
Kornilovitz-Kerensky! Be on\\nguard!\\n\\nRailway men! Stop all troop-trains \
being sent by Kerensky against\\nPetrograd!\\n\\nSoldiers, Workers, Clerical \
employees! The destiny of the Revolution\\nand democratic peace is in your \
hands!\\n\\nLong live the Revolution!\\n\\n_The All-Russian Congress of \
Soviets of_\\n_Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies._\\n_Delegates from the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets._\\n\\nIt \
was exactly 5:17 A.M. when Krylenko, staggering with fatigue,\\nclimbed to \
the tribune with a telegram in his \
hand.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! From the Northern Front. The \
Twelfth Army sends greetings\\nto the Congress of Soviets, announcing the \
formation of a Military\\nRevolutionary Committee which has taken over the \
command of the\\nNorthern Front!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Pandemonium, men \
weeping, embracing each other.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]General Tchermissov \
has recognised the Committee-Commissar of the\\nProvisional Government \
Voitinsky has resigned!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSo. Lenin and the \
Petrograd workers had decided on insurrection, the\\nPetrograd Soviet had \
overthrown the Provisional Government, and\\nthrust the _coup d\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]etat_ upon the Congress of Soviets. Now there was\\nall \
great Russia to win--and then the world! Would Russia follow and\\nrise? And \
the world--what of it? Would the peoples answer and rise, a\\nred world-tide?\
\\n\\nAlthough it was six in the morning, night was yet heavy and \
chill.\\nThere was only a faint unearthly pallor stealing over the \
silent\\nstreets, dimming the watch-fires, the shadow of a terrible \
dawn\\ngrey-rising over Russia....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter V\\n\\nPlunging \
Ahead\\n\\n\\nThursday, November 8th. Day broke on a city in the \
wildest\\nexcitement and confusion, a whole nation having up in long \
hissing\\nswells of storm. Superficially all was quiet; hundreds of thousands\
\\nof people retired at a prudent hour, got up early, and went to work.\\nIn \
Petrograd the street-cars were running, the stores and\\nrestaurants open, \
theatres going, an exhibition of paintings\\nadvertised.... All the complex \
routine of common life--humdrum even in\\nwar-time--proceeded as usual. \
Nothing is so astounding as the\\nvitality of the social organism--how it \
persists, feeding itself,\\nclothing itself, amusing itself, in the face of \
the worst\\ncalamities....\\n\\nThe air was full of rumours about Kerensky, \
who was said to have\\nraised the Front, and to be leading a great army \
against the\\ncapital. _Volia Naroda_ published a _prikaz_ launched by him at\
\\nPskov:\\n\\nThe disorders caused by the insane attempt of the Bolsheviki \
place\\nthe country on the verge of a precipice, and demand the effort \
of\\nour entire will, our courage and the devotion of every one of us, \
to\\nwin through the terrible trial which the fatherland is undergoing....\\n\
\\nUntil the declaration of the composition of the new Government--if\\none \
is formed--every one ought to remain at his post and fulfil his\\nduty toward \
bleeding Russia. It must be remembered that the least\\ninterference with \
existing Army organisations can bring on\\nirreparable misfortunes, by \
opening the Front to the enemy.\\nTherefore it is indispensable to preserve \
at any price the morale of\\nthe troops, by assuring complete order and the \
preservation of the\\nArmy from new shocks, and by maintaining absolute \
confidence between\\nofficers and their subordinates. I order all the chiefs \
and\\nCommissars, in the name of the safety of the country, to stay \
at\\ntheir posts, as I myself retain the post of Supreme Commander, \
until\\nthe Provisional Government of the Republic shall declare its will....\
\\n\\nIn answer, this placard on all the walls:\\n\\nFROM THE ALL-RUSSIAN \
CONGRESS OF SOVIETS\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The ex-Ministers Konovalov, \
Kishkin, Terestchenko, Maliantovitch,\\nNikitin and others have been arrested \
by the Military Revolutionary\\nCommittee. Kerensky has fled. All Army \
organisations are ordered to\\ntake every measure for the immediate arrest of \
Kerensky and his\\nconveyance to Petrograd.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All \
assistance given to Kerensky will be punished as a serious\\ncrime against \
the state.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWith brakes released the Military \
Revolutionary Committee whirled,\\nthrowing off orders, appeals, decrees, \
like sparks. (See App. V,\\nSect. 1)... Kornilov was ordered brought to \
Petrograd. Members of the\\nPeasant Land Committees imprisoned by the \
Provisional Government\\nwere declared free. Capital punishment in the army \
was abolished.\\nGovernment employees were ordered to continue their work, \
and\\nthreatened with severe penalties if they refused. All \
pillage,\\ndisorder and speculation were forbidden under pain of \
death.\\nTemporary Commissars were appointed to the various \
Ministries:\\nForeign Affairs, Vuritsky and Trotzky; Interior and Justice, \
Rykov;\\nLabor, Shliapnikov; Finance, Menzhinsky; Public Welfare, \
Madame\\nKollontai; Commerce, Ways and Communications, Riazanov; Navy, \
the\\nsailor Korbir; Posts and Telegraphs, Spiro; Theatres, Muraviov;\\nState \
Printing Office, Gherbychev; for the City of Petrograd,\\nLieutenant \
Nesterov; for the Northern Front, Pozern....\\n\\nTo the Army, appeal to set \
up Military Revolutionary Committees. To\\nthe railway workers, to maintain \
order, especially not to delay the\\ntransport of food to the cities and the \
front.... In return, they were\\npromised representation in the Ministry of \
Ways and Communications.\\n\\nCossack brothers! (said one proclamation). You \
are being led against\\nPetrograd. They want to force you into battle with \
the revolutionary\\nworkers and soldiers of the capital. Do not believe a \
word that is\\nsaid by our common enemies, the land-owners and the \
capitalists.\\n\\nAt our Congress are represented all the conscious \
organisations of\\nworkers, soldiers and peasants of Russia. The Congress \
wishes also\\nto welcome into its midst the worker-Cossacks. The Generals of \
the\\nBlack Band, henchmen of the land-owners, of Nicolai the Cruel, \
are\\nour enemies.\\n\\nThey tell you that the Soviets wish to confiscate the \
lands of the\\nCossacks. This is a lie. It is only from the great Cossack \
landlords\\nthat the Revolution will confiscate the land to give it to \
the\\npeople.\\n\\nOrganise Soviets of Cossacks\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies! \
Join with the Soviets of\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies!\\n\\nShow the Black Band that you are not \
traitors to the People, and\\nthat you do not wish to be cursed by the whole \
of revolutionary\\nRussia!...\\n\\nCossack brothers, execute no orders of the \
enemies of the people.\\nSend your delegates to Petrograd to talk it over \
with us.... The\\nCossacks of the Petrograd garrison, to their honour, have \
not\\njustified the hope of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
enemies....\\n\\nCossack brothers! The All-Russian Congress of Soviets \
extends to you\\na fraternal hand. Long live the brotherhood of the Cossacks \
with the\\nsoldiers, workers and peasants of all Russia!\\n\\nOn the other \
side, what a storm of proclamations posted up,\\nhand-bills scattered \
everywhere, newspapers--screaming and cursing\\nand prophesying evil. Now \
raged the battle of the printing press--all\\nother weapons being in the \
hands of the Soviets.\\n\\nFirst, the appeal of the Committee for Salvation \
of Country and\\nRevolution, flung broadcast over Russia and Europe:\\n\\nTO \
THE CITIZENS OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC!\\n\\nContrary to the will of the \
revolutionary masses, on November 7th\\nthe Bolsheviki of Petrograd \
criminally arrested part of the\\nProvisional Government, dispersed the \
Council of the Republic, and\\nproclaimed an illegal power. Such violence \
committed against the\\nGovernment of revolutionary Russia at the moment of \
its greatest\\nexternal danger, is an indescribable crime against the \
fatherland.\\n\\nThe insurrection of the Bolsheviki deals a mortal blow to \
the cause\\nof national defence, and postpones immeasurably the moment of \
peace\\nso greatly desired.\\n\\nCivil war, begun by the Bolsheviki, \
threatens to deliver the country\\nto the horrors of anarchy and \
counter-revolution, and cause the\\nfailure of the Constituent Assembly, \
which must affirm the\\nrepublican r\[EAcute]gime and transmit to the People \
forever their right to\\nthe land.\\n\\nPreserving the continuity of the only \
legal Governmental power, the\\nCommittee for Salvation of Country and \
Revolution, established on\\nthe night of November 7th, takes the initiative \
in forming a new\\nProvisional Government; which, basing itself on the forces \
of\\ndemocracy, will conduct the country to the Constituent Assembly \
and\\nsave it from anarchy and counter-revolution. The Committee \
for\\nSalvation summons you, citizens, to refuse to recognise the power \
of\\nviolence. Do not obey its orders!\\n\\nRise for the defence of the \
country and Revolution!\\n\\nSupport the Committee for Salvation!\\n\\nSigned \
by the Council of the Russian Republic, the Municipal Duma of\\nPetrograd, \
the _Tsay-ee-kah (First Congress),_ the Executive\\nCommittee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, and from the Congress itself the\\nFront group, \
the factions of Socialist Revolutionaries, Mensheviki,\\nPopulist Socialists, \
Unified Social Democrats, and the group\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yedinstvo.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen posters from the Socialist Revolutionary \
party, the Mensheviki\\n_oborontsi,_ Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets \
again; from the Central Army\\nCommittee, the _Tsentroflot_....\\n\\n... \
Famine will crush Petrograd! (they cried). The German armies will\\ntrample \
on our liberty. Black Hundred _pogroms_ will spread over\\nRussia, if we \
all--conscious workers, soldiers, citizens--do not\\nunite....\\n\\nDo not \
trust the promises of the Bolsheviki! The promise of\\nimmediate peace--is a \
lie! The promise of bread--a hoax! The promise\\nof land--a fairy tale!...\\n\
\\nThey were all in this manner.\\n\\nComrades! You have been basely and \
cruelly deceived! The seizure of\\npower has been accomplished by the \
Bolsheviki alone.... They concealed\\ntheir plot from the other Socialist \
parties composing the Soviet....\\n\\nYou have been promised land and \
freedom, but the counter-revolution\\nwill profit by the anarchy called forth \
by the Bolsheviki, and will\\ndeprive you of land and freedom....\\n\\nThe \
newspapers were as violent.\\n\\nOur duty (said the _Dielo Naroda_) is to \
unmask these traitors to\\nthe working-class. Our duty is to mobilise all our \
forces and mount\\nguard over the cause of the \
Revolution!...\\n\\n_Izviestia,_ for the last time speaking in the name of \
the old\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ threatened awful retribution.\\n\\nAs for the \
Congress of Soviets, we affirm that there has been no\\nCongress of Soviets! \
We affirm that it was merely a private\\nconference of the Bolshevik faction! \
And in that case, they have no\\nright to cancel the powers of the \
_Tsay-ee-kah_....\\n\\n_Novaya Zhizn,_ while pleading for a new Government \
that should\\nunite all the Socialist parties, criticised severely the action \
of\\nthe Socialist Revolutionaries and the Mensheviki in quitting \
the\\nCongress, and pointed out that the Bolshevik insurrection meant \
one\\nthing very clearly: that all illusions about coalition with \
the\\nbourgeoisie were henceforth demonstrated vain...\\n\\n_Rabotchi Put_ \
blossomed out as _Pravda,_ Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s newspaper which\\nhad \
been suppressed in July. It crowed, bristling:\\n\\nWorkers, soldiers, \
peasants! In March you struck down the tyranny of\\nthe clique of nobles. \
Yesterday you struck down the tyranny of the\\nbourgeois gang....\\n\\nThe \
first task now is to guard the approaches to Petrograd.\\n\\nThe second is \
definitely to disarm the counter-revolutionary\\nelements of \
Petrograd.\\n\\nThe third is definitely to organise the revolutionary power \
and\\nassure the realisation of the popular programme...\\n\\nWhat few Cadet \
organs appeared, and the bourgeoisie generally,\\nadopted a detached, \
ironical attitude toward the whole business, a\\nsort of contemptuous \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I--told--you--so\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] to the other \
parties.\\nInfluential Cadets were to be seen hovering around the \
Municipal\\nDuma, and on the outskirts of the Committee for Salvation. \
Other\\nthan that, the bourgeoisie lay low, biding its hour--which could \
not\\nfar off. That the Bolsheviki would remain in power longer than \
three\\ndays never occurred to anybody--except perhaps to Lenin, Trotzky, the\
\\nPetrograd workers and the simpler soldiers....\\n\\nIn the high, \
amphitheatrical Nicolai Hall that afternoon I saw the\\nDuma sitting in \
_permanence,_ tempestuous, grouping around it all\\nthe forces of opposition. \
The old Mayer, Schreider, majestic with\\nhis white hair and beard, was \
describing his visit to Smolny\\nthe night before, to protest in the name of \
the Municipal\\nSelf-Government. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Duma, being the \
only existing legal Government\\nin the city, elected by equal, direct and \
secret suffrage, would not\\nrecognise the new power,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he had told Trotzky. And Trotzky had\\nanswered, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There \
is a constitutional remedy for that. The Duma can\\nbe dissolved and \
re-elected....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At this report there was a \
furious\\noutcry.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If one recognises a Government \
by bayonet,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] continued the old man,\\naddressing the \
Duma, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]well, we have one; but I consider \
legitimate\\nonly a Government recognised by the majority, and not one \
created by\\nthe usurpation of a minority!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Wild \
applause on all benches except\\nthose of the Bolsheviki. Amid renewed tumult \
the Mayor announced\\nthat the Bolsheviki already were violating Municipal \
autonomy by\\nappointing Commissars in many departments.\\n\\nThe Bolshevik \
speaker shouted, trying to make himself heard, that\\nthe decision of the \
Congress of Soviets meant that all Russia backed\\nup the action of the \
Bolsheviki.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are not the real representative of the \
people\\nof Petrograd!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Shrieks of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Insult! Insult!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The old Mayor, \
with\\ndignity, reminded him that the Duma was elected by the \
freest\\npossible popular vote. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he answered, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]but that was a \
long time\\nago--like the _Tsay-ee-kah_--like the Army Committee.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There has been no new \
Congress of Soviets!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they yelled at him.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolshevik faction refuses to remain any longer in \
this nest of\\ncounter-revolution--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Uproar. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]--and we demand a re-election of the\\nDuma....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Whereupon the Bolsheviki left the chamber, followed \
by cries\\nof \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]German agents! Down with the traitors!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nShingariov, Cadet, then demanded that all \
Municipal functionaries\\nwho had consented to be Commissars of the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee be discharged from their position and indicted. \
Schreider\\nwas on his feet, putting a motion to the effect that the \
Duma\\nprotested against the menace of the Bolsheviki to dissolve it, \
and\\nas the legal representative of the population, it would refuse \
to\\nleave its post.\\n\\nOutside, the Alexander Hall was crowded for the \
meeting of the\\nCommittee for Salvation, and Skobeliev was again speaking. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Never\\nyet,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]was the fate of the Revolution so acute, never \
yet\\ndid the question of the existence of the Russian state excite so\\nmuch \
anxiety, never yet did history put so harshly and categorically\\nthe \
question--is Russia to be or not to be! The great hour for the\\nsalvation of \
the Revolution has arrived, and in consciousness\\nthereof we observe the \
close union of the live forces of the\\nrevolutionary democracy, by whose \
organised will a centre for the\\nsalvation of the country and the Revolution \
has already been\\ncreated....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] And much of the same \
sort. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We shall die sooner than\\nsurrender our post!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAmid violent applause it was announced that the \
Union of Railway\\nWorkers had joined the Committee for Salvation. A few \
moments later\\nthe Post and Telegraph Employees came in; then some \
Mensheviki\\nInternationalists entered the hall, to cheers. The Railway men \
said\\nthey did not recognise the Bolsheviki and had taken the \
entire\\nrailroad apparatus into their own hands, refusing to entrust it \
to\\nany usurpatory power. The Telegraphers\[CloseCurlyQuote] delegate \
declared that the\\noperators had flatly refused to work their instruments as \
long as\\nthe Bolshevik Commissar was in the office. The Postmen would \
not\\ndeliver or accept mail at Smolny.... All the Smolny telephones \
were\\ncut off. With great glee it was reported how Uritzky had gone to \
the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs to demand the secret treaties, and \
how\\nNeratov had put him out. The Government employees were all \
stopping\\nwork....\\n\\nIt was war--war deliberately planned, Russian \
fashion; war by strike\\nand sabotage. As we sat there the chairman read a \
list of names and\\nassignments; so-and-so was to make the round of the \
Ministries;\\nanother was to visit the banks; some ten or twelve were to work \
the\\nbarracks and persuade the soldiers to remain neutral--\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russian\\nsoldiers, do not shed the blood of your \
brothers!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; a committee was\\nto go and confer with \
Kerensky; still others were despatched to\\nprovincial cities, to form \
branches of the Committee for Salvation,\\nand link together the \
anti-Bolshevik elements.\\n\\nThe crowd was in high spirits. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These Bolsheviki _will_ try to\\ndictate to the \
_intelligentzia?_ We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll show \
them!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... Nothing could be\\nmore striking than the \
contrast between this assemblage and the\\nCongress of Soviets. There, great \
masses of shabby soldiers, grimy\\nworkmen, peasants--poor men, bent and \
scarred in the brute struggle\\nfor existence; here the Menshevik and Social \
Revolutionary\\nleaders--Avksentievs, Dans, Liebers,--the former \
Socialist\\nMinisters--Skobelievs, Tchernovs,--rubbed shoulders with Cadets \
like\\noily Shatsky, sleek Vinaver; with journalists, \
students,\\nintellectuals of almost all camps. This Duma crowd was \
well-fed,\\nwell-dressed; I did not see more than three proletarians among \
them\\nall....\\n\\nNews came. Kornilov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s faithful \
_Tekhintsi_[14] had slaughtered his\\nguards at Bykhov, and he had escaped. \
Kaledin was marching north....\\nThe Soviet of Moscow had set up a Military \
Revolutionary Committee,\\nand was negotiating with the commandant of the \
city for possession\\nof the arsenal, so that the workers might be \
armed.\\n\\n[14] See Notes and Explanations.\\n\\nWith these facts was mixed \
an astounding jumble of rumours,\\ndistortions, and plain lies. For instance, \
an intelligent young\\nCadet, formerly private secretary to Miliukov and then \
to\\nTerestchenko, drew us aside and told us all about the taking of \
the\\nWinter Palace.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolsheviki were led by \
German and Austrian officers,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\naffirmed.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Is that so?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] we replied, \
politely. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How do you \
know?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A friend of mine \
was there and saw \
them.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How could he tell \
they were German officers?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, because they wore German uniforms!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThere were hundreds of such absurd tales, and \
they were not only\\nsolemnly published by the anti-Bolshevik press, but \
believed by the\\nmost unlikely persons--Socialist Revolutionaries and \
Mensheviki who\\nhad always been distinguished by their sober devotion to \
facts....\\n\\nBut more serious were the stories of Bolshevik violence \
and\\nterrorism. For example, it was said printed that the Red Guards \
had\\nnot only thoroughly looted the Winter Palace, but that they \
had\\nmassacred the _yunkers_ after disarming them, had killed some of \
the\\nMinisters in cold blood; and as for the woman soldiers, most of \
them\\nhad been violated, and many had committed suicide because of \
the\\ntortures they had gone through.... All these stories were \
swallowed\\nwhole by the crowd in the Duma. And worse still, the mothers \
and\\nfathers of the students and of the women read these \
frightful\\ndetails, _often accompanied by lists of names,_ and toward \
nightfall\\nthe Duma began to be besieged by frantic citizens....\\n\\nA \
typical case is that of Prince Tumanov, whose body, it was\\nannounced in \
many newspapers, had been found floating in the Moika\\nCanal. A few hours \
later this was denied by the Prince\[CloseCurlyQuote]s family, who\\nadded \
that the Prince was under arrest so the press identified the\\ndead man as \
General Demissov. The General having also come to life,\\nwe investigated, \
and could find no trace of any body found whatever....\\n\\nAs we left the \
Duma building two boy scouts were distributing\\nhand-bills (See App. V, \
Sect. 2) to the enormous crowd which blocked\\nthe Nevsky in front of the \
door--a crowd composed almost entirely of\\nbusiness men, shop-keepers, \
_tchinouniki,_ clerks. One read!\\n\\nFROM THE MUNICIPAL DUMA\\n\\nThe \
Municipal Duma in its meeting of October 26th, in view of the\\nevents of the \
day decrees: To announce the inviolability of private\\ndwellings. Through \
the House Committees it calls upon the population\\nof the town of Petrograd \
to meet with decisive repulse all attempts\\nto enter by force private \
apartments, not stopping at the use of\\narms, in the interests of the \
self-defence of citizens.\\n\\nUp on the corner of the Liteiny, five or six \
Red Guards and a couple\\nof sailors had surrounded a news-dealer and were \
demanding that he\\nhand over his copies of the Menshevik _Rabot-chaya \
Gazeta_ (Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nGazette). Angrily he shouted at them, \
shaking his fist, as one of\\nthe sailors tore the papers from his stand. An \
ugly crowd had\\ngathered around, abusing the patrol. One little workman kept\
\\nexplaining doggedly to the people and the news-dealer, over and \
over\\nagain, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It has Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
proclamation in it. It says we killed\\nRussian people. It will make \
bloodshed....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSmolny was tenser than ever, if \
that were possible. The same running\\nmen in the dark corridors, squads of \
workers with rifles, leaders\\nwith bulging portfolios arguing, explaining, \
giving orders as they\\nhurried anxiously along, surrounded by friends and \
lieutenants. Men\\nliterally out of themselves, living prodigies of \
sleeplessness and\\nwork-men unshaven, filthy, with burning eyes, who drove \
upon their\\nfixed purpose full speed on engines of exaltation. So much they \
had\\nto do, so much! Take over the Government, organise the City, keep\\nthe \
garrison loyal, fight the Duma and the Committee for Salvation,\\nkeep out \
the Germans, prepare to do battle with Kerensky, inform the\\nprovinces what \
had happened, Propagandise from Archangel to\\nVladivostok.... Government and \
Municipal employees refusing to obey\\ntheir Commissars, post and telegraph \
refusing them communication,\\nrailroads roads stonily ignoring their appeals \
for trains, Kerensky\\ncoming, the garrison not altogether to be trusted, the \
Cossacks\\nwaiting to come out.... Against them not only the \
organised\\nbourgeoisie, but all the other Socialist parties except the \
Left\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, a few Mensheviki Internationalists \
and\\nthe Social Democrat Internationalists, and even they \
undecided\\nwhether to stand by or not. With them, it is true, the workers \
and\\nthe soldier-masses--the peasants an unknown quantity--but after \
all\\nthe Bolsheviki were a political faction not rich in trained \
and\\neducated men....\\n\\nRiazanov was coming up the front steps, \
explaining in a sort of\\nhumorous panic that he, Commissar of Commerce, knew \
nothing whatever\\nof business. In the upstairs cafe sat a man all by himself \
in the\\ncorner, in a goat-skin cape and clothes which had been--I was \
going\\nto say \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]slept in,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] but \
of course he hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t slept--and a three \
days\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\ngrowth of beard. He was anxiously figuring on a \
dirty envelope, and\\nbiting his pencil meanwhile. This was Menzhinsky, \
Commissar of\\nFinance, whose qualifications were that he had once been clerk \
in a\\nFrench bank.... And these four half-running down the hall from \
the\\noffice of the Military Revolutionary Committee, and scribbling \
on\\nbits of paper as they run--these were Commissars despatched to \
the\\nfour corners of Russia to carry the news, argue, or \
fight--with\\nwhatever arguments or weapons came to hand....\\n\\nThe \
Congress was to meet at one o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock, and long since the \
great\\nmeeting-hall had filled, but by seven there was yet no sign of \
the\\npresidium.... The Bolshevik and Left Social Revolutionary \
factions\\nwere in session in their own rooms. All the livelong afternoon \
Lenin\\nand Trotzky had fought against compromise. A considerable part \
of\\nthe Bolsheviki were in favour of giving way so far as to create \
a\\njoint all-Socialist government. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t hold on!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they cried.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Too much is against us. We haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
got the men. We will be\\nisolated, and the whole thing will fall.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] So Kameniev, Riazanov and\\nothers.\\n\\nBut Lenin, \
with Trotzky beside him, stood firm as a rock. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let the\
\\ncompromisers accept our programme and they can come in! We won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\ngive way an inch. If there are comrades here who haven\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the courage\\nand the will to dare what we dare, let them \
leave with the rest of\\nthe cowards and conciliators! Backed by the workers \
and soldiers we\\nshall go on.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt five minutes \
past seven came word from the left Socialist\\nRevolutionaries to say that \
they would remain in the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Lenin. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They are following!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA \
little later, as we sat at the press table in the big hall, an\\nAnarchist \
who was writing for the bourgeois papers proposed to me\\nthat we go and find \
out what had become of the presidium. There was\\nnobody in the _Tsay-ee-kah_ \
office, nor in the bureau of the\\nPetrograd Soviet. From room to room we \
wandered, through vast\\nSmolny. Nobody seemed to have the slightest idea \
where to find the\\ngoverning body of the Congress. As we went my companion \
described\\nhis ancient revolutionary activities, his long and pleasant exile \
in\\nFrance.... As for the Bolsheviki, he confided to me that they \
were\\ncommon, rude, ignorant persons, without aesthetic sensibilities. \
He\\nwas a real specimen of the Russian _intelligentzia_.... So he came \
at\\nlast to Room 17, office of the Military Revolutionary Committee, \
and\\nstood there in the midst of all the furious coming and going. \
The\\ndoor opened, and out shot a squat, flat-faced man in a \
uniform\\nwithout insignia, who seemed to be smiling--which smile, after \
a\\nminute, one saw to be the fixed grin of extreme fatigue. It \
was\\nKrylenko.\\n\\nMy friend, who was a dapper, civilized-looking young \
man, gave a cry\\nof pleasure and stepped forward.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Nicolai Vasilievitch!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \
holding out his hand. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
you\\nremember me, comrade? We were in prison together.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nKrylenko made an effort and concentrated his \
mind and sight. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why\\nyes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
answered finally, looking the other up and down with an\\nexpression of great \
friendliness. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are S--. \
_Zdra\[CloseCurlyQuote]stvuitye!_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nThey kissed. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What are you doing in all \
this?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He waved his arm\\naround.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]am just looking on.... You seem \
very successful.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] replied Krylenko, with a sort of doggedness, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The proletarian\\nRevolution is a great success.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He laughed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Perhaps--perhaps,\
\\nhowever, we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll meet in prison again!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWhen we got out into the corridor again my \
friend went on with his\\nexplanations. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You see, I\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a follower of Kropotkin. To us the\\nRevolution is a \
great failure; it has not aroused the patriotism of\\nthe masses. Of course \
that only proves that the people are not ready\\nfor Revolution....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIt was just 8.40 when a thundering wave of \
cheers announced the\\nentrance of the presidium, with Lenin--great \
Lenin--among them. A\\nshort, stocky figure, with a big head set down in his \
shoulders,\\nbald and bulging. Little eyes, a snubbish nose, wide, \
generous\\nmouth, and heavy chin; clean-shaven now, but already beginning \
to\\nbristle with the well-known beard of his past and future. Dressed \
in\\nshabby clothes, his trousers much too long for him. Unimpressive, \
to\\nbe the idol of a mob, loved and revered as perhaps few leaders \
in\\nhistory have been. A strange popular leader--a leader purely by\\nvirtue \
of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising and\\ndetached, without \
picturesque idiosyncrasies--but with the power of\\nexplaining profound ideas \
in simple terms, of analysing a concrete\\nsituation. And combined with \
shrewdness, the greatest intellectual\\naudacity.\\n\\nKameniev was reading \
the report of the actions of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee; \
abolition of capital punishment in the\\nArmy, restoration of the free right \
of propaganda, release of\\nofficers and soldiers arrested for political \
crimes, orders to\\narrest Kerensky and confiscation of food supplies in \
private\\nstore-houses.... Tremendous applause.\\n\\nAgain the representative \
of the _Bund._ The uncompromising attitude\\nof the Bolsheviki would mean the \
crushing of the Revolution;\\ntherefore, the _Bund_ delegates must refuse any \
longer to sit in the\\nCongress. Cries from the audience, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We thought you walked out last\\nnight! How many times \
are you going to walk out?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen the \
representative of the Mensheviki Internationalists. Shouts,\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What! You here still?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The \
speaker explained that only part of the\\nMensheviki Internationalists left \
the Congress; the rest were going\\nto stay--\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
consider it dangerous and perhaps even mortal for the Revolution\\nto \
transfer the power to the Soviets\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--Interruptions--\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]but we feel it\\nour duty to remain in the Congress \
and vote against the transfer\\nhere!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOther \
speakers followed, apparently without any order. A delegate of\\nthe \
coal-miners of the Don Basin called upon the Congress to take\\nmeasures \
against Kaledin, who might cut off coal and food from the\\ncapital. Several \
soldiers just arrived from the Front brought the\\nenthusiastic greetings of \
their regiments.... Now Lenin, gripping the\\nedge of the reading stand, \
letting his little winking eyes travel\\nover the crowd as he stood there \
waiting, apparently oblivious to\\nthe long-rolling ovation, which lasted \
several minutes. When it\\nfinished, he said simply, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We shall now proceed to construct the\\nSocialist \
order!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Again that overwhelming human roar.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The first thing is the adoption of practical measures \
to realise\\npeace.... We shall offer peace to the peoples of all the \
belligerent\\ncountries upon the basis of the Soviet terms--no annexations, \
no\\nindemnities, and the right of self-determination of peoples. At \
the\\nsame time, according to our promise, we shall publish and \
repudiate\\nthe secret treaties.... The question of War and Peace is so clear \
that\\nI think that I may, without preamble, read the project of \
a\\nProclamation to the Peoples of All the Belligerent Countries....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHis great mouth, seeming to smile, opened wide \
as he spoke; his\\nvoice was hoarse--not unpleasantly so, but as if it had \
hardened that\\nway after years and years of speaking--and went on \
monotonously, with\\nthe effect of being able to go on forever.... For \
emphasis he bent\\nforward slightly. No gestures. And before him, a thousand \
simple\\nfaces looking up in intent adoration.\\n\\nPROCLAMATION TO THE \
PEOPLES AND GOVERNMENTS OF ALL THE BELLIGERENT\\nNATIONS.\\n\\nThe Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government, created by the \
revolution of\\nNovember 6th and 7th and based on the Soviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, proposes to all the belligerent peoples and\\nto \
their Governments to begin immediately negotiations for a just\\nand \
democratic peace.\\n\\nThe Government means by a just and democratic peace, \
which is\\ndesired by the immense majority of the workers and the \
labouring\\nclasses, exhausted and depleted by the war--that peace which \
the\\nRussian workers and peasants, after having struck down the \
Tsarist\\nmonarchy, have not ceased to demand categorically--immediate \
peace\\nwithout annexations (that is to say, without conquest of \
foreign\\nterritory, without forcible annexation of other nationalities), and\
\\nwithout indemnities.\\n\\nThe Government of Russia Proposes to all the \
belligerent peoples\\nimmediately to conclude such a peace, by showing \
themselves willing\\nto enter upon the decisive steps of negotiations aiming \
at such a\\npeace, at once, without the slightest delay, before the \
definitive\\nratification of all the conditions of such a peace by the \
authorised\\nassemblies of the people of all countries and of all \
nationalities.\\n\\nBy annexation or conquest of foreign territory, the \
Government\\nmeans--conformably to the conception of democratic rights in \
general,\\nand the rights of the working-class in particular--all union to \
a\\ngreat and strong State of a small or weak nationality, without \
the\\nvoluntary, clear and precise expression of its consent and \
desire;\\nwhatever be the moment when such an annexation by force \
was\\naccomplished, whatever be the degree civilisation of the \
nation\\nannexed by force or maintained outside the frontiers of \
another\\nState, no matter if that nation be in Europe or in the far \
countries\\nacross the sea.\\n\\nIf any nation is retained by force within \
the limits of another\\nState; if, in spite of the desire expressed by it, \
(it matters\\nlittle if that desire be expressed by the press, by \
popular\\nmeetings, decisions of political parties, or by disorders and riots\
\\nagainst national oppression), that nation is not given the right \
of\\ndeciding by free vote--without the slightest constraint, after \
the\\ncomplete departure of the armed forces of the nation which \
has\\nannexed it or wishes to annex it or is stronger in general--the \
form\\nof its national and political organisation, such a union \
constitutes\\nan annexation--that is to say, conquest and an act of violence.\
\\n\\nTo continue this war in order to permit the strong and rich \
nations\\nto divide among themselves the weak and conquered nationalities \
is\\nconsidered by the Government the greatest possible crime \
against\\nhumanity; and the Government solemnly proclaims its decision to \
sign\\na treaty of peace which will put an end to this war upon the \
above\\nconditions, equally fair for all nationalities without \
exception.\\n\\nThe Government abolishes secret diplomacy, expressing before \
the\\nwhole country its firm decision to conduct all the negotiations \
in\\nthe light of day before the people, and will proceed immediately \
to\\nthe full publication of all secret treaties confirmed or concluded\\nby \
the Government of land-owners and capitalists, from March until\\nNovember \
7th, 1917. All the clauses of the secret treaties which, as\\noccur in a \
majority of cases, have for their object to procure\\nadvantages and \
privileges for Russian capitalists, to maintain or\\naugment the annexations \
of the Russian imperialists, are denounced\\nby the Government immediately \
and without discussion.\\n\\nIn proposing to all Governments and all peoples \
to engage in public\\nnegotiations for peace, the Government declares itself \
ready to\\ncarry on these negotiations by telegraph, by post, or by \
pourparlers\\nbetween the representatives of the different countries, or at a\
\\nconference of these representatives. To facilitate these\\npourparlers, \
the Government appoints its authorised representatives\\nin the neutral \
countries.\\n\\nThe Government proposes to all the governments and to the \
peoples of\\nall the belligerent countries to conclude an immediate \
armistice, at\\nthe same time suggesting that the armistice ought to last \
three\\nmonths, during which time it is perfectly possible, not only to \
hold\\nthe necessary pourparlers between the representatives of all \
the\\nnations and nationalities without exception drawn into the war \
or\\nforced to take part in it, but also to convoke authorised \
assemblies\\nof representatives of the people of all countries, for the \
purpose\\nof the definite acceptance of the conditions of peace.\\n\\nIn \
addressing this offer of peace to the Governments and to the\\npeoples of all \
the belligerent countries, the Provisional Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government of Russia addresses equally and \
in\\nparticular the conscious workers of the three nations most devoted\\nto \
humanity and the three most important nations among those taking\\npart in \
the present war--England, France, and Germany. The workers of\\nthese \
countries have rendered the greatest services to the cause of\\nprogress and \
of Socialism. The splendid examples of the Chartist\\nmovement in England, \
the series of revolutions, of world-wide\\nhistorical significance, \
accomplished by the French proletariat--and\\nfinally, in Germany, the \
historic struggle against the Laws of\\nException, an example for the workers \
of the whole world of\\nprolonged and stubborn action, and the creation of \
the formidable\\norganisations of German proletarians--all these models of \
proletarian\\nheroism, these monuments of history, are for us a sure \
guarantee\\nthat the workers of these countries will understand the duty \
imposed\\nupon them to liberate humanity from the horrors and consequences of\
\\nwar; and that these workers, by decisive, energetic and \
continued\\naction, will help us to bring to a successful conclusion the \
cause\\nof peace--and at the same time, the cause of the liberation of \
the\\nexploited working masses from all slavery and all \
exploitation.\\n\\nWhen the grave thunder of applause had died away, Lenin \
spoke again:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We propose to the Congress to ratify \
this declaration. We address\\nourselves to the Governments as well as to the \
peoples, for a\\ndeclaration which would be addressed only to the peoples of \
the\\nbelligerent countries might delay the conclusion of peace. \
The\\nconditions of peace, drawn up during the armistice, will be \
ratified\\nby the Constituent Assembly. In fixing the duration of the \
armistice\\nat three months, we desire to give to the peoples as long a rest \
as\\npossible after this bloody extermination, and ample time for them \
to\\nelect their representatives. This proposal of peace will meet \
with\\nresistance on the part of the imperialist governments--we don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t fool\\nourselves on that score. But we hope that \
revolution will soon break\\nout in all the belligerent countries; that is \
why we address\\nourselves especially to the workers of France, England and \
Germany....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The revolution of November 6th and \
7th,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he ended, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]has opened \
the\\nera of the Social Revolution.... The labour movement, in the name \
of\\npeace and Socialism, shall win, and fulfil its destiny....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThere was something quiet and powerful in all \
this, which stirred\\nthe souls of men. It was understandable why people \
believed when\\nLenin spoke....\\n\\nBy crowd vote it was quickly decided \
that only representatives of\\npolitical factions should be allowed to speak \
on the motion and that\\nspeakers should be limited to fifteen \
minutes.\\n\\nFirst Karelin for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our faction\\nhad no opportunity to propose amendments \
to the text of the\\nproclamation; it is a private document of the \
Bolsheviki. But we\\nwill vote for it because we agree with its spirit....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFor the Social Democrats Internationalists \
Kramarov, long,\\nstoop-shouldered and near-sighted--destined to achieve some \
notoriety\\nas the Clown of the Opposition. Only a Government composed of all\
\\nthe Socialist parties, he said, could possess the authority to take\\nsuch \
important action. If a Socialist coalition were formed, his\\nfaction would \
support the entire programme; if not, only part of it.\\nAs for the \
proclamation, the Internationalists were in thorough\\naccord with its main \
points....\\n\\nThen one after another, amid rising enthusiasm; Ukrainean \
Social\\nDemocracy, support; Lithuanian Social Democracy, support; \
Populist\\nSocialists, support; Polish Social Democracy, support; \
Polish\\nSocialists support--but would prefer a Socialist coalition; \
Lettish\\nSocial Democracy, support.... Something was kindled in these men. \
One\\nspoke of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]coming World-Revolution, of which \
we are the\\nadvance-guard\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; another of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the new age of brotherhood, when all the\\npeoples \
will become one great family....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] An individual member \
claimed\\nthe floor. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is contradiction here,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]First you \
offer\\npeace without annexations and indemnities, and then you say you \
will\\nconsider all peace offers. To consider means to accept....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nLenin was on his feet. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We want a just peace, but we are not afraid\\nof a \
revolutionary war.... Probably the imperialist Governments will\\nnot answer \
our appeal--but we shall not issue an ultimatum to which\\nit will be easy to \
say no.... If the German proletariat realises that\\nwe are ready to consider \
all offers of peace, that will perhaps be\\nthe last drop which overflows the \
bowl--revolution will break out \
in\\nGermany....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We consent to examine all \
conditions of peace, but that doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nmean that we shall \
accept them.... For some of our terms we shall\\nfight to the end--but \
possibly for others will find it impossible to\\ncontinue the war.... Above \
all, we want to finish the war....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIt was \
exactly 10:35 when Kameniev asked all in favour of the\\nproclamation to hold \
up their cards. One delegate dared to raise his\\nhand against, but the \
sudden sharp outburst around him brought it\\nswiftly down.... \
Unanimous.\\n\\nSuddenly, by common impulse, we found ourselves on our \
feet,\\nmumbling together into the smooth lifting unison of \
the\\n_Internationale._ A grizzled old soldier was sobbing like a \
child.\\nAlexandra Kollontai rapidly winked the tears back. The immense sound\
\\nrolled through the hall, burst windows and doors and seared into \
the\\nquiet sky. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The war is ended! The war is ended!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said a young\\nworkman near me, his face shining. \
And when it was over, as we stood\\nthere in a kind of awkward hush, some one \
in the back of the room\\nshouted, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! Let us \
remember those who have died for\\nliberty!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] So we \
began to sing the Funeral March, that slow,\\nmelancholy and yet triumphant \
chant, so Russian and so moving. The\\n_Internationale_ is an alien air, \
after all. The Funeral March\\nseemed the very soul of those dark masses \
whose delegates sat in\\nthis hall, building from their obscure visions a new \
Russia--and\\nperhaps more.\\n\\nYou fell in the fatal fight\\n\\nFor the \
liberty of the people, for the honour of the people....\\n\\nYou gave up your \
lives and everything dear to you,\\n\\nYou suffered in horrible \
prisons,\\n\\nYou went to exile in chains....\\n\\nWithout a word you carried \
your chains because you could not ignore\\nyour suffering \
brothers,\\n\\nBecause you believed that justice is stronger than the \
sword....\\n\\nThe time will come when your surrendered life will \
count\\n\\nThat time is near; when tyranny falls the people will rise, \
great\\nand free!\\n\\nFarewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,\\n\\nYou \
are followed by the new and fresh army ready to die and \
to\\nsuffer....\\n\\nFarewell, brothers, you chose a noble path,\\n\\nAt your \
grave we swear to fight, to work for freedom and the\\npeople\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s happiness....\\n\\nFor this did they lie there, the \
martyrs of March, in their cold\\nBrotherhood Grave on Mars Field; for this \
thousands and tens of\\nthousands had died in the prisons, in exile, in \
Siberian mines. It\\nhad not come as they expected it would come, nor as \
the\\n_intelligentzia_ desired it; but it had come--rough, \
strong,\\nimpatient of formulas, contemptuous of sentimentalism; \
real....\\n\\nLenin was reading the Decree on Land:\\n\\n(1.) All private \
ownership of land is abolished immediately without\\ncompensation.\\n\\n(2.) \
All land-owners\[CloseCurlyQuote] estates, and all lands belonging to the \
Crown,\\nto monasteries, church lands with all their live stock \
and\\ninventoried property, buildings and all appurtenances, \
are\\ntransferred to the disposition of the township Land Committees \
and\\nthe district Soviets of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies until the \
Constituent\\nAssembly meets.\\n\\n(3.) Any damage whatever done to the \
confiscated property which from\\nnow on belongs to the whole People, is \
regarded as a serious crime,\\npunishable by the revolutionary tribunals. The \
district Soviets of\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies shall take all \
necessary measures for the\\nobservance of the strictest order during the \
taking over of the\\nland-owners\[CloseCurlyQuote] estates, for the \
determination of the dimensions of the\\nplots of land and which of them are \
subject to confiscation, for the\\ndrawing up of an inventory of the entire \
confiscated property, and\\nfor the strictest revolutionary protection of all \
the farming\\nproperty on the land, with all buildings, implements, \
cattle,\\nsupplies of products, etc., passing into the hands of the \
People.\\n\\n(4.) For guidance during the realisation of the great land \
reforms\\nuntil their final resolution by the Constituent Assembly, \
shall\\nserve the following peasant _nakaz_ (See App. V, Sect. \
3)\\n(instructions), drawn up on the basis of 242 local peasant _nakazi_\\nby \
the editorial board of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Izviestia_ of the \
All-Russian Soviet\\nof Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and published in No.88 of said _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Izviestia\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n(Petrograd, \
No.88, August 19th, 1917).\\n\\nThe lands of peasants and of Cossacks serving \
in the Army shall not\\nbe confiscated.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is \
not,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] explained Lenin, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the \
project of former Minister\\nTchernov, who spoke of \[OpenCurlyQuote]erecting \
a frame-work\[CloseCurlyQuote] and tried to realise\\nreforms from above. \
From below, on the spot, will be decided the\\nquestions of division of the \
land. The amount of land received by\\neach peasant will vary according to \
the locality....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Under the Provisional \
Government, the _pomieshtchiki_ flatly\\nrefused to obey the orders of the \
Land Committees--those Land\\nCommittees projected by Lvov, brought into \
existence by Shingariov,\\nand administered by Kerensky!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBefore the debates could begin a man forced his \
way violently\\nthrough the crowd in the aisle and climbed upon the platform. \
It was\\nPianikh, member of the Executive Committee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets,\\nand he was mad clean through.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Executive Committee of the All-Russian Soviets of \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies protests against the arrest of our \
comrades, the Ministers\\nSalazkin and Mazlov!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
flung harshly in the faces of the crowd,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We demand \
their instant release! They are now in Peter-Paul\\nfortress. We must have \
immediate action! There is not a moment to\\nlose!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\nAnother followed him, a soldier with disordered beard and flaming\\neyes. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You sit here and talk about giving the land to the \
peasants,\\nand you commit an act of tyrants and usurpers against the \
peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nchosen representatives! I tell you--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he raised his fist, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If \
one\\nhair of their heads is harmed, you\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll have a revolt on \
your hands!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nThe crowd stirred confusedly.\\n\\nThen \
up rose Trotzky, calm and venomous, conscious of power, greeted\\nwith a \
roar. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yesterday the Military Revolutionary Committee \
decided\\nto release the Socialist Revolutionary and Menshevik \
Ministers,\\nMazlov, Salazkin, Gvozdov and Maliantovitch--on principle. That \
they\\nare still in Peter-Paul is only because we have had so much to \
do....\\nThey will, however, be detained at their homes under arrest until we\
\\nhave investigated their complicity in the treacherous acts of\\nKerensky \
during the Kornilov affair!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Never,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shouted Pianikh, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in any revolution have such things been\\nseen as go \
on here!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are \
mistaken,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] responded Trotzky. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Such things have been seen\\neven in this revolution. \
Hundreds of our comrades were arrested in\\nthe July days.... When Comrade \
Kollontai was released from prison by\\nthe doctor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s orders, \
Avksentiev placed at her door two former agents\\nof the Tsar\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s secret police!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The peasants \
withdrew, muttering,\\nfollowed by ironical hoots.\\n\\nThe representative of \
the Left Socialist Revolutionaries spoke on\\nthe Land Decree. While agreeing \
in principle, his faction could not\\nvote on the question until after \
discussion. The Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets\\nshould be \
consulted....\\n\\nThe Mensheviki Internationalists, too, insisted on a party \
caucus.\\n\\nThen the leader of the Maximalists, the Anarchist wing of \
the\\npeasants: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must do honour to a political party \
which puts such an\\nact into effect the first day, without jawing about it!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA typical peasant was in the tribune, long \
hair, boots and\\nsheep-skin coat, bowing to all corners of the hall. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I wish you\\nwell, comrades and citizens,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There are some \
Cadets\\nwalking around outside. You arrested our Socialist peasants--why not\
\\narrest them?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThis was the signal for a debate \
of excited peasants. It was\\nprecisely like the debate of soldiers of the \
night before. Here were\\nthe real proletarians of the land....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Those members of our Executive Committee, Avksentiev \
and the rest,\\nwhom we thought were the peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
protectors--they are only Cadets\\ntoo! Arrest them! Arrest them!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAnother, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are these \
Pianikhs, these Avksentievs? They are not\\npeasants at all! They only wag \
their tails!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHow the crowd rose to them, \
recognising brothers!\\n\\nThe Left Socialist Revolutionaries proposed a \
half-hour\\nintermission. As the delegates streamed out, Lenin stood up in \
his\\nplace.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must not lose time, comrades! \
News all-important to Russia must\\nbe on the press to-morrow morning. No \
delay!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAnd above the hot discussion, argument, \
shuffling of feet could be\\nheard the voice of an emissary of the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee, crying, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Fifteen agitators \
wanted in room 17 at once! To\\ngo to the \
Front!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]...\\n\\nIt was almost two hours and a half \
later that the delegates came\\nstraggling back, the presidium mounted the \
platform, and the session\\nrecommenced by the reading of telegrams from \
regiment after\\nregiment, announcing their adhesion to the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee.\\n\\nIn leisurely manner the meeting gathered \
momentum. A delegate from\\nthe Russian troops on the Macedonian front spoke \
bitterly of their\\nsituation. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We suffer there more \
from the friendship of our \[OpenCurlyQuote]Allies\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nthan \
from the enemy,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. Representatives of the Tenth \
and\\nTwelfth Armies, just arrived in hot haste, reported, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We support you\\nwith all our strength!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A peasant-soldier protested against the\\nrelease of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the traitor Socialists, Mazlov and Salazkin\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; as for the\\nExecutive Committee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, it should be arrested\\n_en masse!_Here was real \
revolutionary talk.... A deputy from the\\nRussian Army in Persia declared he \
was instructed to demand all\\npower to the Soviets.... A Ukrainean officer, \
speaking in his native\\ntongue: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is no \
nationalism in this crisis.... _Da zdravstvuyet_\\nthe proletarian \
dictatorship of all lands!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Such a deluge of \
high\\nand hot thoughts that surely Russia would never again be \
dumb!\\n\\nKameniev remarked that the anti-Bolshevik forces were trying to \
stir\\nup disorders everywhere, and read an appeal of the Congress to \
all\\nthe Soviets of Russia:\\n\\nThe All-Russian Congress of Soviets of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies, \
including some Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, calls upon the \
local\\nSoviets to take immediate energetic measures to oppose \
all\\ncounter-revolutionary anti-Jewish action and all _pogroms,_ \
whatever\\nthey may be. The honour of the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nRevolution demands that \
no _pogrom_ be tolerated.\\n\\nThe Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary \
garrison and the\\nsailors have maintained complete order in the \
capital.\\n\\nWorkers, soldiers and peasants, you should follow everywhere \
the\\nexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.\\n\\nComrade soldiers \
and Cossacks, on us falls the duty of assuring real\\nrevolutionary order.\\n\
\\nAll revolutionary Russia and the entire world have their eyes on us....\\n\
\\nAt two o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock the Land Decree was put to vote, with only \
one\\nagainst and the peasant delegates wild with joy.... So plunged \
the\\nBolsheviki ahead, irresistible, over-riding hesitation \
and\\nopposition--the only people in Russia who had a definite programme \
of\\naction while the others talked for eight long months.\\n\\nNow arose a \
soldier, gaunt, ragged and eloquent, to protest against\\nthe clause of the \
_nakaz_ tending to deprive military deserters from\\na share in village land \
allotments. Bawled at and hissed at first,\\nhis simple, moving speech \
finally made silence. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Forced against his\\nwill into \
the butchery of the trenches,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]which you\\nyourselves, in the Peace decree, have \
voted senseless as well as\\nhorrible, he greeted the Revolution with hope of \
peace and freedom.\\nPeace? The Government of Kerensky forced him again to go \
forward\\ninto Galicia to slaughter and be slaughtered; to his pleas \
for\\npeace, Terestchenko simply laughed.... Freedom? Under Kerensky \
he\\nfound his Committees suppressed, his newspapers cut off, his \
party\\nspeakers put in prison.... At home in his village, the landlords were\
\\ndefying his Land Committees, jailing his comrades.... In Petrograd \
the\\nbourgeoisie, in alliance with the Germans, were sabotaging the \
food\\nand ammunition for the Army.... He was without boots, or clothes.... \
Who\\nforced him to desert? The Government of Kerensky, which you \
have\\noverthrown!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At the end there was \
applause.\\n\\nBut another soldier hotly denounced it: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government of Kerensky\\nis not a screen behind \
which can be hidden dirty work like\\ndesertion! Deserters are scoundrels, \
who run away home and leave\\ntheir comrades to die in the trenches alone! \
Every deserter is a\\ntraitor, and should be punished....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Uproar, shouts of _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do \
volno!\\nTeesche!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ Kameniev hastily proposed to leave \
the matter to the\\nGovernment for decision. (See App. V, Sect. 4)\\n\\nAt \
2.30 A. M. fell a tense hush. Kameniev was reading the decree of\\nthe \
Constitution of Power:\\n\\nUntil the meeting of the Constituent Assembly, a \
provisional\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Government is formed, which shall be named\\nthe Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars. (See App. V, Sect. 5)\\n\\nThe administration \
of the different branches of state activity shall\\nbe intrusted to \
commissions, whose composition shall be regulated to\\nensure the carrying \
out of the programme of the Congress, in close\\nunion with the \
mass-organisations of working-men, working-women,\\nsailors, soldiers, \
peasants and clerical employees. The governmental\\npower is vested in a \
_collegium_ made up of the chairmen of these\\ncommissions, that is to say, \
the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\\nControl over the \
activities of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars, and the\\nright to \
replace them, shall belong to the All-Russian Congress of\\nSoviets of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, and its\\nCentral Executive \
Committee.\\n\\nStill silence; as he read the list of Commissars, bursts of \
applause\\nafter each name, Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and Trotzky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s especially.\\n\\n_President of the Council:_ Vladimir \
Ulianov _(Lenin)_\\n\\n_Interior:_ A. E. Rykov\\n\\n_Agriculture:_ V. P. \
Miliutin\\n\\n_Labour:_ A. G. Shliapnikov\\n\\n_Military and Naval \
Affairs_--a committee composed of V. A.\\n\\n_Avseenko (Antonov),_ N. V. \
Krylenko, and F. M. Dybenko.\\n\\n_Commerce and Industry:_ V. P. \
Nogin\\n\\n_Popular Education:_ A. V. Lunatcharsky\\n\\n_Finance:_ E. E. \
Skvortsov _(Stepanov)_\\n\\n_Foreign Affairs:_ L. D. Bronstein _(Trotzky)_\\n\
\\n_Justice:_ G. E. Oppokov _(Lomov)_\\n\\n_Supplies:_ E. A. \
Teodorovitch\\n\\n_Post and Telegraph:_ N. P. Avilov \
_(Gliebov)_\\n\\n_Chairman for Nationalities:_ I. V. Djougashvili \
_(Stalin)_\\n\\n_Railroads:_ To be filled later.\\n\\nThere were bayonets at \
the edges of the room, bayonets pricking up\\namong the delegates; the \
Military Revolutionary Committee was arming\\neverybody, Bolshevism was \
arming for the decisive battle with\\nKerensky, the sound of whose trumpets \
came up the south-west wind....\\nIn the meanwhile nobody went home; on the \
contrary hundreds of\\nnewcomers filtered in, filling the great room solid \
with stern-faced\\nsoldiers and workmen who stood for hours and hours, \
indefatigably\\nintent. The air was thick with cigarette smoke, and human \
breathing,\\nand the smell of coarse clothes and sweat.\\n\\nAvilov of the \
staff of _Novaya Zhizn_ was speaking in the name of\\nthe Social Democrat \
Internationalists and the remnant of the\\nMensheviki Internationalists; \
Avilov, with his young, intelligent\\nface, looking out of place in his smart \
frock-coat.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must ask ourselves where we are \
going.... The ease with which the\\nCoalition Government was upset cannot be \
explained by the strength\\nof the left wing of the democracy, but only by \
the incapacity of the\\nGovernment to give the people peace and bread. And \
the left wing\\ncannot maintain itself in power unless it can solve these \
questions....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Can it give bread to the people? \
Grain is scarce. The majority of\\nthe peasants will not be with you, for you \
cannot give them the\\nmachinery they need. Fuel and other primary \
necessities are almost\\nimpossible to procure....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As for peace, that will be even more difficult. The \
allies refused\\nto talk with Skobeliev. They will never accept the \
proposition of a\\npeace conference from _you._ You will not be recognised \
either in\\nLondon and Paris, or in \
Berlin....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You cannot count on the effective help \
of the proletariat of the\\nAllied countries, because in most countries it is \
very far from the\\nrevolutionary struggle; remember, the Allied democracy \
was unable\\neven to convoke the Stockholm Conference. Concerning the \
German\\nSocial Democrats, I have just talked with Comrade Goldenberg, one of\
\\nour delegates to Stockholm; he was told by the representatives of\\nthe \
Extreme Left that revolution in Germany was impossible during\\nthe war....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Here interruptions began to come thick and fast, but\
\\nAvilov kept on.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The isolation of Russia will \
fatally result either in the defeat of\\nthe Russian Army by the Germans, and \
the patching up of a peace\\nbetween the Austro-German coalition and the \
Franco-British coalition\\n_at the expense of Russia_--or in a separate peace \
with Germany.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have just learned that the Allied \
ambassadors are preparing to\\nleave, and that Committees for Salvation of \
Country and Revolution\\nare forming in all the cities of Russia....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No one party can conquer these enormous difficulties. \
The majority\\nof the people, supporting a government of Socialist coalition, \
can\\nalone accomplish the Revolution....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]He then \
read the resolution of the two factions:\\n\\nRecognising that for the \
salvation of the conquests of the\\nRevolution it is indispensable \
immediately to constitute a\\ngovernment based on the revolutionary democracy \
organised in the\\nSoviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, \
recognising\\nmoreover that the task of this government is the quickest \
possible\\nattainment of peace, the transfer of the land into the hands of \
the\\nagrarian committees, the organisation of control over \
industrial\\nproduction, and the convocation of the Constituent Assembly on \
the\\ndate decided, the Congress appoints an executive committee \
to\\nconstitute such a government after an agreement with the groups of\\nthe \
democracy which are taking part in the Congress.\\n\\nIn spite of the \
revolutionary exaltation of the triumphant crowd,\\nAvilov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
cool tolerant reasoning had shaken them. Toward the end,\\nthe cries and \
hisses died away, and when he finished there was even\\nsome \
clapping.\\n\\nKarelin followed him--also young, fearless, whose sincerity no \
one\\ndoubted--for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, the party of \
Maria\\nSpiridonova, the party which almost alone followed the \
Bolsheviki,\\nand which represented the revolutionary peasants.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our party has refused to enter the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars\\nbecause we do not wish forever to separate \
ourselves from the part\\nof the revolutionary army which left the Congress, \
a separation\\nwhich would make it impossible for us to serve as \
intermediaries\\nbetween the Bolsheviki and the other groups of the \
democracy.... And\\nthat is our principal duty at this moment. We cannot \
sustain any\\ngovernment except a government of Socialist coalition....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We protest, moreover, against the tyrannical conduct \
of the\\nBolsheviki. Our Commissars have been driven from their posts. \
Our\\nonly organ, _Znamia Truda_ (Banner of Labour), was forbidden \
to\\nappear yesterday....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Central Duma is \
forming a powerful Committee for Salvation of\\nCountry and Revolution, to \
fight you. Already you are isolated, and\\nyour Government is without the \
support of a single other democratic\\ngroup....\\n\\nAnd now Trotzky stood \
upon the raised tribune, confident and\\ndominating, with that sarcastic \
expression about his mouth which was\\nalmost a sneer. He spoke, in a ringing \
voice, and the great crowd\\nrose to him.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These \
considerations on the dangers of isolation of our party are\\nnot new. On the \
eve of insurrection our fatal defeat was also\\npredicted. Everybody was \
against us; only a faction of the Socialist\\nRevolutionaries of the left was \
with us in the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee. How is it that we were \
able to overturn the\\nGovernment almost without bloodshed?.... That fact is \
the most\\nstriking proof that we _were not isolated._ In reality \
the\\nProvisional Government was isolated; the democratic parties \
which\\nmarch against us were isolated, are isolated, and forever cut \
off\\nfrom the proletariat!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They speak of the \
necessity for a coalition. There is only one\\ncoalition possible--the \
coalition of the workers, soldiers and\\npoorest peasants; and it is our \
party\[CloseCurlyQuote]s honour to have realised that\\ncoalition.... What \
sort of coalition did Avilov mean? A coalition with\\nthose who supported the \
Government of Treason to the People?\\nCoalition doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
always add to strength. For example, could we have\\norganised the \
insurrection with Dan and Avksentiev in our \
ranks?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nRoars of laughter.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Avksentiev gave little bread. Will a coalition with \
the _oborontsi_\\nfurnish more? Between the peasants and Avksentiev, who \
ordered the\\narrest of the Land Committees, we choose the peasants! \
Our\\nRevolution will remain the classic revolution of history....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They accuse us of repelling an agreement with the \
other democratic\\nparties. But is it we who are to blame? Or must we, as \
Karelin put\\nit, blame it on a \[OpenCurlyQuote]misunderstanding\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]? No, comrades. When a party in\\nfull tide of revolution, \
still wreathed in powder-smoke, comes to\\nsay, \[OpenCurlyQuote]Here is the \
Power--take it!\[CloseCurlyQuote]--and when those to whom it is\\noffered go \
over to the enemy, that is not a misunderstanding.... that\\nis a declaration \
of pitiless war. And it isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t we who have declared\\nwar....\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Avilov menaces us with failure of our peace \
efforts--if we remain\\n\[OpenCurlyQuote]isolated.\[CloseCurlyQuote] I \
repeat, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t see how a coalition with Skobeliev, \
or\\neven Terestchenko, can help us to get peace! Avilov tries to\\nfrighten \
us by the threat of a peace at our expense. And I answer\\nthat in any case, \
if Europe continues to be ruled by the imperialist\\nbourgeoisie, \
revolutionary Russia will inevitably be \
lost....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There are only two alternatives; either \
the Russian Revolution will\\ncreate a revolutionary movement in Europe, or \
the European powers\\nwill destroy the Russian Revolution!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThey greeted him with an immense crusading \
acclaim, kindling to the\\ndaring of it, with the thought of championing \
mankind. And from that\\nmoment there was something conscious and decided \
about the\\ninsurrectionary masses, in all their actions, which never left \
them.\\n\\nBut on the other side, too, battle was taking form. \
Kameniev\\nrecognised a delegate from the Union of Railway Workers, \
a\\nhardfaced, stocky man with an attitude of implacable hostility. \
He\\nthrew a bombshell.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In the name of the \
strongest organisation in Russia I demand the\\nright to speak, and I say to \
you: the _Vikzhel_ charges me to make\\nknown the decision of the Union \
concerning the constitution of\\nPower. The Central Committee refuses \
absolutely to support the\\nBolsheviki if they persist in isolating \
themselves from the whole\\ndemocracy of Russia!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Immense tumult all over the hall.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In 1905, and in \
the Kornilov days, the Railway Workers were the\\nbest defenders of the \
Revolution. But you did not invite us to your\\nCongress--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Cries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was the old \
_Tsay-ee-kah_ which did not invite\\nyou!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The orator \
paid no attention. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We do not recognise the\\nlegality \
of this Congress; since the departure of the Mensheviki and\\nSocialist \
Revolutionaries there is not a legal quorum.... The Union\\nsupports the old \
_Tsay-ee-Kah,_ and declares that the Congress has\\nno right to elect a new \
Committee....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Power should be a Socialist and \
revolutionary Power,\\nresponsible before the authorised organs of the entire \
revolutionary\\ndemocracy. Until the constitution of such a power, the Union \
of\\nRailway Workers, which refuses to transport \
counter-revolutionary\\ntroops to Petrograd, at the same time forbids the \
execution of any\\norder whatever without the consent of the _Vikzhel._ The \
_Vikzhel_\\nalso takes into its hands the entire administration of the \
railroads\\nof Russia.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt the end he could \
hardly be heard for the furious storm of abuse\\nwhich beat upon him. But it \
was a heavy blow--that could be seen in\\nthe concern on the faces of the \
presidium. Kameniev, however, merely\\nanswered that there could be no doubt \
of the legality of the\\nCongress, as even the quorum established by the old \
_Tsay-ee-Kah_\\nwas exceeded--in spite of the secession of the Mensheviki and\
\\nSocialist Revolution arises....\\n\\nThen came the vote on the \
Constitution of Power, which carried the\\nCouncil of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars into office by an enormous \
majority....\\n\\nThe election of the new _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the new parliament \
of the\\nRussian Republic, took barely fifteen minutes. Trotzky announced its\
\\ncomposition: 100 members, of which 70 Bolsheviki.... As for \
the\\npeasants, and the seceding factions, places were to be reserved \
for\\nthem. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We welcome into the Government all parties \
and groups which\\nwill adopt our programme,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] ended \
Trotzky.\\n\\nAnd thereupon the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets \
was\\ndissolved, so that the members might hurry to their homes in the\\nfour \
corners of Russia and tell of the great happenings....\\n\\nIt was almost \
seven when we woke the sleeping conductors and\\nmotor-men of the street-cars \
which the Street-Railway Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Union\\nalways kept \
waiting at Smolny to take the Soviet delegates to their\\nhomes. In the \
crowded car there was less happy hilarity than the\\nnight before, I thought. \
Many looked anxious; perhaps they were\\nsaying to themselves, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now we are masters, how can we do our will?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt our apartment-house we were held up in the \
dark by an armed\\npatrol of citizens and carefully examined. The Duma\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proclamation\\nwas doing its work....\\n\\nThe landlady \
heard us come in, and stumbled out in a pink silk\\nwrapper.\\n\\nThe House \
Committee has again asked that you take your turn on\\nguard-duty with the \
rest of the men,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she said.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the reason for this \
guard-duty?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To protect \
the house and the women and children.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who from?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Robbers and murderers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But suppose there came a Commissar from the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee to search for arms?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, that\[CloseCurlyQuote]s what \
they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll _say_ they are.... And besides, what\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the\\ndifference?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nI solemnly \
affirmed that the Consul had forbidden all American\\ncitizens to carry \
arms--especially in the neighbourhood of the\\nRussian \
_intelligentzia_....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VI\\n\\nThe Committee for \
Salvation\\n\\n\\nFriday, November 9th....\\n\\nNovotcherkask, November \
8th.\\n\\nIn view of the revolt of the Bolsheviki, and their attempt to \
depose\\nthe Provisional Government and to seize the power in Petrograd... \
the\\nCossack Government declares that it considers these acts criminal\\nand \
absolutely inadmissible. In consequence, the Cossacks will lend\\nall their \
support to the Provisional Government, which is a\\ngovernment of coalition. \
Because of these circumstances, and until\\nthe return of the Provisional \
Government to power, and the\\nrestoration of order in Russia, I take upon \
myself, beginning\\nNovember 7th, all the power in that which concerns the \
region of the\\nDon.\\n\\nSigned: ATAMAN KALEDIN\\n\\n_President of the \
Government of the Cossack Troops._\\n\\n_Prikaz_ of the Minister-President \
Kerensky, dated at Gatchina:\\n\\nI, Minister-President of the Provisional \
Government, and Supreme\\nCommander of all the armed forces of the Russian \
Republic, declare\\nthat I am at the head of regiments from the Front who \
have remained\\nfaithful to the fatherland.\\n\\nI order all the troops of \
the Military District of Petrograd, who\\nthrough mistake or folly have \
answered the appeal of the traitors to\\nthe country and the Revolution, to \
return to their duty without\\ndelay.\\n\\nThis order shall be read in all \
regiments, battalions and squadrons.\\n\\nSigned: _Minister-President of the \
Provisional_\\n\\n_Government and Supreme Commander_\\n\\nA. F. \
KERENSKY.\\n\\nTelegram from Kerensky to the General in Command of the \
Northern\\nFront:\\n\\nThe town of Gatchina has been taken by the loyal \
regiments without\\nbloodshed. Detachments of Cronstadt sailors, and of the \
Semionovsky\\nand Ismailovsky regiments, gave up their arms without \
resistance and\\njoined the Government troops.\\n\\nI order all the \
designated units to advance as quickly as possible.\\nThe Military \
Revolutionary Committee has ordered its troops \
to\\nretreat....\\n\\nGatchina, about thirty kilometers south-west, had \
fallen during the\\nnight. Detachments of the two regiments mentioned--not \
the\\nsailors--while wandering captainless in the neighbourhood, had \
indeed\\nbeen surrounded by Cossacks and given up their arms; but it was \
not\\ntrue that they had joined the Government troops. At this very \
moment\\ncrowds of them, bewildered and ashamed, were up at Smolny trying \
to\\nexplain. They did not think the Cossacks were so near.... They \
had\\ntried to argue with the Cossacks....\\n\\nApparently the greatest \
confusion prevailed along the revolutionary\\nfront. The garrisons of all the \
little towns southward had split\\nhopelessly, bitterly into two factions--or \
three: the high command\\nbeing on the side of Kerensky, in default of \
anything stronger, the\\nmajority of the rank and file with the Soviets, and \
the rest\\nunhappily wavering.\\n\\nHastily the Military Revolutionary \
Committee appointed to command\\nthe defence of Petrograd an ambitious \
regular Army Captain,\\nMuraviov, the same Muraviov who had organised the \
Death Battalions\\nduring the summer, and had once been heard to advise the \
Government\\nthat \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]it was too lenient with the \
Bolsheviki; they must be wiped\\nout.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A man of \
military mind, who admired power and audacity,\\nperhaps \
sincerely....\\n\\nBeside my door when I came down in the morning were posted \
two new\\norders of the Military Revolutionary Committee, directing that \
all\\nshops and stores should open as usual, and that all empty rooms \
and\\napartments should be put at the disposal of the Committee....\\n\\nFor \
thirty-six hours now the Bolsheviki had been cut off from\\nprovincial Russia \
and the outside world. The railway men and\\ntelegraphers refused to transmit \
their despatches, the postmen would\\nnot handle their mail. Only the \
Government wireless at Tsarskoye\\nSelo launched half-hourly bulletins and \
manifestoes to the four\\ncorners of heaven; the Commissars of Smolny raced \
the Commissars of\\nthe City Duma on speeding trains half across the earth; \
and two\\naeroplanes, laden with propaganda, fled high up toward the \
Front....\\n\\nBut the eddies of insurrection were spreading through Russia \
with a\\nswiftness surpassing any human agency. Helsingfors Soviet \
passed\\nresolutions of support; Kiev Bolsheviki captured the arsenal and the\
\\ntelegraph station, only to be driven out by delegates to the\\nCongress of \
Cossacks, which happened to be meeting there; in Kazan,\\na Military \
Revolutionary Committee arrested the local garrison staff\\nand the Commissar \
of the Provisional Government; from far\\nKrasnoyarsk, in Siberia, came news \
that the Soviets were in control\\nof the Municipal institutions; at Moscow, \
where the situation was\\naggravated by a great strike of leather-workers on \
one side, and a\\nthreat of general lock-out on the other, the Soviets had \
voted\\noverwhelmingly to support the action of the Bolsheviki \
in\\nPetrograd.... Already a Military Revolutionary Committee \
was\\nfunctioning.\\n\\nEverywhere the same thing happened. The common \
soldiers and the\\nindustrial workers supported the Soviets by a vast \
majority; the\\nofficers, _yunkers_ and middle class generally were on the \
side of\\nthe Government--as were the bourgeois Cadets and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nSocialist parties. \
In all these towns sprang up Committees for\\nSalvation of Country and \
Revolution, arming for civil war....\\n\\nVast Russia was in a state of \
solution. As long ago as 1905 the\\nprocess had begun; the March Revolution \
had merely hastened it, and\\ngiving birth to a sort of forecast of the new \
order, had ended by\\nmerely perpetuating the hollow structure of the old \
regime. Now,\\nhowever, the Bolsheviki, in one night, had dissipated it, as \
one\\nblows away smoke. Old Russia was no more; human society flowed\\nmolten \
in primal heat, and from the tossing sea of flame was\\nemerging the class \
struggle, stark and pitiless--and the fragile,\\nslowly-cooling crust of new \
planets....\\n\\nIn Petrograd sixteen Ministries were on strike, led by \
the\\nMinistries of Labour and of Supplies--the only two created by \
the\\nall-Socialist Government of August.\\n\\nIf ever men stood alone the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]handful of Bolsheviki\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
apparently stood\\nalone that grey chill morning, with all storms towering \
over them.\\n(See App. VI, Sect. 1) Back against the wall, the \
Military\\nRevolutionary Committee struck--for its life. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_De l\[CloseCurlyQuote]audace, encore\\nde l\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]audace, et toujours de l\[CloseCurlyQuote]audace_....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At five in the morning the\\nRed Guards entered the \
printing office of the City Government,\\nconfiscated thousands of copies of \
the Appeal-Protest of the Duma,\\nand suppressed the official Municipal \
organ--the _Viestnik Gorodskovo\\nSamoupravleniya_ (Bulletin of the Municipal \
Self-Government). All\\nthe bourgeois newspapers were torn from the presses, \
even the _Golos\\nSoldata,_ journal of the old _Tsay-ee-kah_--which, however, \
changing\\nits name to _Soldatski Golos,_ appeared in an edition of a hundred\
\\nthousand copies, bellowing rage and defiance:\\n\\nThe men who began their \
stroke of treachery in the night, who have\\nsuppressed the newspapers, will \
not keep the country in ignorance\\nlong. The country will know the truth! It \
will appreciate you,\\nMessrs. the Bolsheviki! We shall see!...\\n\\nAs we \
came down the Nevsky a little after midday the whole street\\nbefore the Duma \
building was crowded with people. Here and there\\nstood Red Guards and \
sailors, with bayonetted rifles, each one\\nsurrounded by about a hundred men \
and women--clerks, students,\\nshopkeepers, _tchinovniki_--shaking their \
fists and bawling insults\\nand menaces. On the steps stood boy-scouts and \
officers,\\ndistributing copies of the _Soldatski Golos._ A workman with a \
red\\nband around his arm and a revolver in his hand stood trembling \
with\\nrage and nervousness in the middle of a hostile throng at the \
foot\\nof the stairs, demanding the surrender of the papers.... Nothing \
like\\nthis, I imagine, ever occurred in history. On one side a handful \
of\\nworkmen and common soldiers, with arms in their hands, representing\\na \
victorious insurrection--and perfectly miserable; on the other a\\nfrantic \
mob made up of the kind of people that crowd the sidewalks\\nof Fifth Avenue \
at noon-time, sneering, abusing, shouting,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Traitors! \
Provocators! _Opritchniki!_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote][15]\\n\\n[15] Savage \
body-guards if Ivan the Terrible, 17th century.\\n\\nThe doors were guarded \
by students and officers with white arm-bands\\nlettered in red, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Militia of the Committee of Public Safety,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and\\nhalf a dozen boy-scouts came and went. \
Upstairs the place was all\\ncommotion. Captain Gomberg was coming down the \
stairs. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They\[CloseCurlyQuote]re\\ngoing to dissolve \
the Duma,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
Bolshevik Commissar is\\nwith the Mayor now.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] As we \
reached the top Riazanov came hurrying\\nout. He had been to demand that the \
Duma recognise the Council of\\npeoples\[CloseCurlyQuote] Commissars, and the \
Mayor had given him a flat refusal.\\n\\nIn the offices a great babbling \
crowd, hurrying, shouting,\\ngesticulating--Government officials, \
intellectuals, journalists,\\nforeign correspondents, French and British \
officers.... \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The City\\nEngineer pointed to them \
triumphantly. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Embassies recognise the\\nDuma as \
the only power now,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he explained. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]For these Bolshevik\\nmurderers and robbers it is only \
a question of hours. All Russia is\\nrallying to us....\\n\\nIn the Alexander \
Hall a monster meeting of the Committee for\\nSalvation. Fillipovsky in the \
chair and Skobeliev again in the\\ntribune, reporting, to immense applause, \
new adhesions to the\\nCommittee; Executive Committee of Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, old\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ Central Army Committee, \
_Tsentroflot,_ Menshevik,\\nSocialist Revolutionary and Front group delegates \
from the Congress\\nof Soviets, Central Committees of the Menshevik, \
Socialist\\nRevolutionary, Populist Socialist parties. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yedinstvo\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] group,\\nPeasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Union, Cooperatives, Zemstvos, Municipalities, Post \
and\\nTelegraph Unions, _Vikzhel,_ Council of the Russian Republic, \
Union\\nof Unions,[16] Merchants\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Manufacturers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Association....\\n\\n[16] See Notes and \
Explanations.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote].... The power of the Soviets is \
not democratic power, but a\\ndictatorship--and not the dictatorship of the \
proletariat, but\\n_against_ the proletariat. All those who have felt or know \
how to\\nfeel revolutionary enthusiasm must join now for the defence of \
the\\nRevolution....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The problem of the day is \
not only to render harmless irresponsible\\ndemagogues, but to fight against \
the counter-revolution.... If rumours\\nare true that certain generals in the \
provinces are attempting to\\nprofit by events in order to march on Petrograd \
with other designs,\\nit is only one more proof that we must establish a \
solid base of\\ndemocratic government. Otherwise, troubles with the Right \
will\\nfollow troubles from the Left....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
garrison of Petrograd cannot remain indifferent when citizens\\nbuying the \
_Golos Soldata_ and newsboys selling the _Rabotchaya\\nGazeta_ are arrested \
in the streets....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The hour of resolutions has \
passed.... Let those who have no longer\\nfaith in the Revolution retire.... \
To establish a united power, we\\nmust again restore the prestige of the \
Revolution....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let us swear that either the \
Revolution shall be saved--or we \
shall\\nperish!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe hall rose, cheering, with \
kindling eyes. There was not a single\\nproletarian anywhere in \
sight....\\n\\nThen Weinstein:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must remain \
calm, and not act until public opinion is firmly\\ngrouped in support of the \
Committee for Salvation--then we can pass\\nfrom the defensive to action!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe _Vikzhel_ representative announced that his \
organisation was\\ntaking the initiative in forming the new Government, and \
its\\ndelegates were now discussing the matter with Smolny.... Followed \
a\\nhot discussion: were the Bolsheviki to be admitted to the \
new\\nGovernment? Martov pleaded for their admission; after all, he \
said,\\nthey represented an important political party. Opinions were \
very\\nmuch divided upon this, the right wing Mensheviki and \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries, as well as the Populist Socialists, \
the\\nCooperatives and the bourgeois elements being bitterly \
against....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They have betrayed Russia,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] one speaker said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They have \
started\\ncivil war and opened the front to the Germans. The Bolsheviki \
must\\nbe mercilessly crushed....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSkobeliev was \
in favor of excluding both the Bolsheviki and the\\nCadets.\\n\\nWe got into \
conversation with a young Socialist Revolutionary, who\\nhad walked out of \
the Democratic Conference to gether with the\\nBolsheviki, that night when \
Tseretelli and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]compromisers\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
forced\\nCoalition upon the democracy of \
Russia.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You here?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked \
him.\\n\\nHis eyes flashed fire. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I left the Congress \
with my\\nparty Wednesday night. I have not risked my life for twenty \
years\\nand more to submit now to the tyranny of the Dark People. \
Their\\nmethods are intolerable. But they have not counted on the \
peasants....\\nWhen the peasants begin to act, then it is a question of \
minutes\\nbefore they are done for.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But the peasants--will they act? Doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the Land decree settle the\\npeasants? What more do they \
want?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah, the Land \
decree!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said furiously. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, do you know what\\nthat Land decree is? It is \
_our_ decree--it is the Socialist\\nRevolutionary programme, intact! My party \
framed that policy, after\\nthe most careful compilation of the wishes of the \
peasants\\nthemselves. It is an outrage....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But if it is your own policy, why do you object? If it \
is the\\npeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] wishes, why will they oppose it?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand! Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you see that the \
peasants will\\nimmediately realise that it is all a trick--that these \
usurpers have\\nstolen the Socialist Revolutionary programme?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nI asked if it were true that Kaledin was \
marching north.\\n\\nHe nodded, and rubbed his hands with a sort of bitter \
satisfaction.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes. Now you see what these Bolsheviki \
have done. They have raised\\nthe counter-revolution against us. The \
Revolution is lost. The\\nRevolution is lost.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you defend the Revolution?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course we will defend \
it--to the last drop of our blood. But we\\nwon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t cooperate \
with the Bolsheviki in any way....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But if Kaledin comes to Petrograd, and the Bolsheviki \
defend the\\ncity. Won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you join with them?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course not. We will \
defend the city also, but we won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t support\\nthe Bolsheviki. \
Kaledin is the enemy of the Revolution, but the\\nBolsheviki are equally \
enemies of the Revolution.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Which do you prefer--Kaledin or the Bolsheviki?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is not a question to \
be discussed!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he burst out impatiently. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\\ntell you, the Revolution is lost. And it is the \
Bolsheviki who are\\nto blame. But listen--why should we talk of such things? \
Kerensky is\\ncoming.... Day after to-morrow we shall pass to the \
offensive....\\nAlready Smolny has sent delegates inviting us to form a \
new\\nGovernment. But we have them now--they are absolutely impotent.... \
We\\nshall not cooperate....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOutside there was a \
shot. We ran to the windows. A Red Guard,\\nfinally exasperated by the taunts \
of the crowd, had shot into it,\\nwounding a young girl in the arm. We could \
see her being lifted into\\na cab, surrounded by an excited throng, the \
clamour of whose voices\\nfloated up to us. As we looked, suddenly an \
armoured automobile\\nappeared around the corner of the Mikhailovsky, its \
guns sluing this\\nway and that. Immediately the crowd began to run, as \
Petrograd\\ncrowds do, falling down and lying still in the street, piled in \
the\\ngutters, heaped up behind telephone-poles. The car lumbered up to\\nthe \
steps of the Duma and a man stuck his head out of the turret,\\ndemanding the \
surrender of the _Soldatski Golos._ The boy-scouts\\njeered and scuttled into \
the building. After a moment the automobile\\nwheeled undecidedly around and \
went off up the Nevsky, while some\\nhundreds of men and women picked \
themselves up and began to dust\\ntheir clothes....\\n\\nInside was a \
prodigious running-about of people with armfuls of\\n_Soldatski Golos,_ \
looking for places to hide them....\\n\\nA journalist came running into the \
room, waving a paper.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Here\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a \
proclamation from Krasnov!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. Everybody \
crowded\\naround. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Get it printed--get it printed \
quick, and around to the\\nbarracks!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBy the \
order of the Supreme Commander I am appointed commandant of\\nthe troops \
concentrated under Petrograd.\\n\\nCitizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of \
the Don, of the Kuban, of\\nthe Transbaikal, of the Amur, of the Yenissei, to \
all you who have\\nremained faithful to your oath I appeal; to you who have \
sworn to\\nguard inviolable your oath of Cossack--I call upon you to \
save\\nPetrograd from anarchy, from famine, from tyranny, and to \
save\\nRussia from the indelible shame to which a handful of ignorant \
men,\\nbought by the gold of Wilhelm, are trying to submit her.\\n\\nThe \
Provisional Government, to which you swore fidelity in the great\\ndays of \
March, is not overthrown, but by violence expelled from the\\nedifice in \
which it held its meetings. However the Government, with\\nthe help of the \
Front armies, faithful to their duty, with the help\\nof the Council of \
Cossacks, which has united under its command all\\nthe Cossacks and which, \
strong with the morale which reigns in its\\nranks, and acting in accordance \
with the will of the Russian people,\\nhas sworn to serve the country as its \
ancestors served it in the\\nTroublous Times of 1612, when the Cossacks of \
the Don delivered\\nMoscow, menaced by the Swedes, the Poles, and the \
Lithuanians. Your\\nGovernment still exists....\\n\\nThe active army \
considers these criminals with horror and contempt.\\nTheir acts of vandalism \
and pillage, their crimes, the German\\nmentality with which they regard \
Russia--stricken down but not yet\\nsurrendered--have alienated from them the \
entire people.\\n\\nCitizens, soldiers, valorous Cossacks of the garrison of \
Petrograd;\\nsend me your delegates so that I may know who are traitors to \
their\\ncountry and who are not, that there may be avoided an effusion \
of\\ninnocent blood.\\n\\nAlmost the same moment word ran from group to group \
that the\\nbuilding was surrounded by Red Guards. An officer strode in, a red\
\\nband around his arm, demanding the Mayor. A few minutes later he\\nleft \
and old Schreider came out of his office, red and pale by turns.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A special meeting of the Duma!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Immediately!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn \
the big hall proceedings were halted. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All members of \
the Duma\\nfor a special meeting!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the matter?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
know--going to arrest us--going to dissolve the\\nDuma--arresting members at \
the door--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] so ran the excited comments.\\n\\nIn the \
Nicolai Hall there was barely room to stand. The Mayor\\nannounced that \
troops were stationed at all the doors, prohibiting\\nall exit and entrance, \
and that a Commissar had threatened arrest\\nand the dispersal of the \
Municipal Duma. A flood of impassioned\\nspeeches from members, and even from \
the galleries, responded. The\\nfreely-elected City Government could not be \
dissolved by _any_\\npower; the Mayor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s person and that of \
all the members were\\ninviolable; the tyrants, the provocators, the German \
agents should\\nnever be recognised; as for these threats to dissolve us, let \
them\\ntry--only over our dead bodies shall they seize this chamber, \
where\\nlike the Roman senators of old we await with dignity the coming \
of\\nthe Goths....\\n\\nResolution, to inform the Dumas and Zemstvos of all \
Russia by\\ntelegraph. Resolution, that it was impossible for the Mayor or \
the\\nChairman of the Duma to enter into any relations whatever \
with\\nrepresentatives of the Military Revolutionary Committee or with \
the\\nso-called Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars. Resolution, \
to address\\nanother appeal to the population of Petrograd to stand up for \
the\\ndefence of their elected town government. Resolution, to remain \
in\\npermanent session....\\n\\nIn the meanwhile one member arrived with the \
information that he had\\ntelephoned to Smolny, and that the Military \
Revolutionary Committee\\nsaid that no orders had been given to surround the \
Duma, that the\\ntroops would be withdrawn....\\n\\nAs we went downstairs \
Riazanov burst in through the front door, very\\nagitated.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are you going to dissolve the Duma?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]My God, no!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he answered. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is all a \
mistake. I told the Mayor\\nthis morning that the Duma would be left \
alone....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOut on the Nevsky, in the deepening \
dusk, a long double file of\\ncyclists came riding, guns slung on their \
shoulders. They halted,\\nand the crowd pressed in and deluged them with \
questions.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you? Where do you come from?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked a fat old man with a\\ncigar in his \
mouth.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Twelfth Army. From the front. We came to \
support the Soviets\\nagainst the damn\[CloseCurlyQuote] bourgeoisie!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] were furious cries. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bolshevik \
gendarmes! Bolshevik Cossacks!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA little officer \
in a leather coat came running down the steps. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The\\ngarrison is turning!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
muttered in my ear. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the \
beginning of\\nthe end of the Bolsheviki. Do you want to see the turn of the \
tide?\\nCome on!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He started at a half-trot up the \
Mikhailovsky, and we\\nfollowed.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What regiment is \
it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The _brunnoviki_....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Here was indeed serious trouble. The\\n_brunnoviki_ \
were the Armoured Car troops, the key to the situation;\\nwhoever controlled \
the _brunnoviki_ controlled the city. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The\\nCommissars \
of the Committee for Salvation and the Duma have been\\ntalking to them. \
There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a meeting on to decide....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Decide what? Which side they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll fight \
on?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, no. That\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s not the way to do it. They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll never \
fight against\\nthe Bolsheviki. They will vote to remain neutral--and then \
the\\n_yunkers_ and Cossacks--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe door of the \
great Mikhailovsky Riding-School yawned blackly. Two\\nsentinels tried to \
stop us, but we brushed by hurriedly, deaf to\\ntheir indignant \
expostulations. Inside only a single arc-light\\nburned dimly, high up near \
the roof of the enormous hall, whose\\nlofty pilasters and rows of windows \
vanished in the gloom. Around\\ndimly squatted the monstrous shapes of the \
armoured cars. One stood\\nalone in the centre of the place, under the light, \
and round it were\\ngathered some two thousand dun-colored soldiers, almost \
lost in the\\nimmensity of that imperial building. A dozen men, officers, \
chairmen\\nof the Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees and speakers, were \
perched on top of the\\ncar, and from the central turret a soldier was \
speaking. This was\\nKhanjunov, who had been president of last summer\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all-Russian\\nCongress of _Brunnoviki._ A lithe, handsome \
figure in his leather\\ncoat with lieutenant\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
shoulder-straps, he stood pleading eloquently\\nfor neutrality.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is an awful thing,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]for Russians to kill their Russian\\nbrothers. There \
must not be civil war between soldiers who stood\\nshoulder to shoulder \
against the Tsar, and conquered the foreign\\nenemy in battles which will go \
down in history! What have we,\\nsoldiers, got to do with these squabbles of \
political parties? I\\nwill not say to you that the Provisional Government \
was a democratic\\nGovernment; we want no coalition with the bourgeoisie--no. \
But we\\nmust have a Government of the united democracy, or Russia is \
lost!\\nWith such a Government there will be no need for civil war, and \
the\\nkilling of brother by brother!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThis \
sounded reasonable--the great hall echoed to the crash of hands\\nand voices.\
\\n\\nA soldier climbed up, his face white and strained, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\ncried, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I came from the Rumanian front, to urgently tell you \
all:\\nthere must be peace! Peace at once! Whoever can give us \
peace,\\nwhether it be the Bolsheviki or this new Government, we will follow.\
\\nPeace! We at the front cannot fight any longer. We cannot fight\\neither \
Germans or Russians--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] With that he leaped down, and a \
sort of\\nconfused agonised sound rose up from all that surging mass, \
which\\nburst into something like anger when the next speaker, a \
Menshevik\\n_oboronetz,_ tried to say that the war must go on until the \
Allies\\nwere victorious.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You talk like Kerensky!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shouted a rough voice.\\n\\nA Duma delegate, \
pleading for neutrality. Him they listened to,\\nmuttering uneasily, feeling \
him not one of them. Never have I seen\\nmen trying so hard to understand, to \
decide. They never moved, stood\\nstaring with a sort of terrible intentness \
at the speaker, their\\nbrows wrinkled with the effort of thought, sweat \
standing out on\\ntheir foreheads; great giants of men with the innocent \
clear eyes of\\nchildren and the faces of epic warriors....\\n\\nNow a \
Bolshevik was speaking, one of their own men, violently, full\\nof hate. They \
liked him no more than the other. It was not their\\nmood. For the moment \
they were lifted out of the ordinary run of\\ncommon thoughts, thinking in \
terms of Russia, of Socialism, the\\nworld, as if it depended on them whether \
the Revolution were to live\\nor die....\\n\\nSpeaker succeeded speaker, \
debating amid tense silence, roars of\\napproval, or anger: should we come \
out or not? Khanjunov returned,\\npersuasive and sympathetic. But wasn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t he an officer, and an\\n_oboronotz,_ however much he \
talked of peace? Then a workman from\\nVasili Ostrov, but him they greeted \
with, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And are _you_ going to\\ngive us peace, \
working-man?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Near us some men, many of \
them\\nofficers, formed a sort of _claque_ to cheer the advocates \
of\\nNeutrality. They kept shouting, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Khanjunov! \
Khanjunov!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and whistled\\ninsultingly when the \
Bolsheviki tried to speak.\\n\\nSuddenly the committeemen and officers on top \
of the automobile\\nbegan to discuss something with great heat and much \
gesticulation.\\nThe audience shouted to know what was the matter, and all \
the great\\nmass tossed and stirred. A soldier, held back by one of \
the\\nofficers, wrenched himself loose and held up his hand.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrade Krylenko is here and wants to speak\\nto us.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] An outburst of cheers, whistlings, yells of _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Prosim!\\nProsim! Dolby!_ Go ahead! Go ahead! Down \
with him!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in the midst of\\nwhich the People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar for Military Affairs clambered up the\\nside of \
the car, helped by hands before and behind, pushed and\\npulled from below \
and above. Rising he stood for a moment, and then\\nwalked out on the \
radiator, put his hands on his hips and looked\\naround smiling, a squat, \
short-legged figure, bare-headed, without\\ninsignia on his uniform.\\n\\nThe \
_claque_ near me kept up a fearful shouting, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Khanjunov! We want\\nKhanjunov! Down with him! Shut \
up! Down with the traitor!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The whole\\nplace seethed \
and roared. Then it began to move, like an avalanche\\nbearing down upon us, \
great black-browed men forcing their way\\nthrough.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who is breaking up our \
meeting?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they shouted. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who is \
whistling\\nhere?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The _claque,_ rudely burst asunder, \
went flying--nor did it\\ngather \
again....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrade soliders!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] began Krylenko, in a voice husky with fatigue.\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I cannot speak well to you; I am sorry; but I have not \
had any\\nsleep for four nights....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need to tell you that I am a soldier. I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need to tell\\nyou that I want peace. What I must say is \
that the Bolshevik party,\\nsuccessful in the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution, by the help of\\nyou and of all the \
rest of the brave comrades who have of you and of\\nall the rest of the brave \
comrades who have hurled down forever the\\npower of the blood-thirsty \
bourgeoisie, promised to offer peace to\\nall the peoples, and that has \
already been done--to-day!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Tumultuous\\napplause.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are asked to remain \
neutral--to remain neutral while the\\n_yunkers_ and the Death Battalions, \
who are _never_ neutral, shoot\\nus down in the streets and bring back to \
Petrograd Kerensky--or\\nperhaps some other of the gang. Kaledin is marching \
from the Don.\\nKerensky is coming from the front. Kornilov is raising \
the\\n_Tekhintsi_ to repeat his attempt of August. All these Mensheviki\\nand \
Socialist Revolutionaries who call upon you now to prevent civil\\nwar--how \
have they retained the power except by civil war, that civil\\nwar which has \
endured ever since last July, and in which they\\nconstantly stood on the \
side of the bourgeoisie, as they do now?\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How can \
I persuade you, if you have made up your minds? The\\nquestion is very plain. \
On one side are Kerensky, Kaledin, Kornilov,\\nthe Mensheviki, Socialist \
Revolutionaries, Cadets, Dumas, officers....\\nThey tell us that their \
objects are good. On the other side are the\\nworkers, the soldiers and \
sailors, the poorest peasants. The\\nGovernment is in your hands. You are the \
masters. Great Russia\\nbelongs to you. Will you give it back?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWhile he spoke, he kept himself up by sheer \
evident effort of will,\\nand as he went on the deep sincere feeling back of \
his words broke\\nthrough the tired voice. At the end he totered, almost \
falling; a\\nhundred hands reached up to help him down, and the great dim \
spaces\\nof the hall gave back the surf of sound that beat upon \
him.\\n\\nKhanjunov tried to speak again, but \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Vote! \
Vote! Vote!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they cried.\\nAt length, giving in, he \
read the resolution: that the _brunnoviki_\\nwithdraw their representative \
from the Military Revolutionary\\nCommittee, and declare their neutrality in \
the present civil war.\\nAll those in favour should go to the right; those \
opposed, to the\\nleft. There was a moment of hesitation, a still expectancy, \
and then\\nthe crowd began to surge faster and faster, stumbling over \
one\\nanother, to the left, hundreds of big soldiers in a solid \
mass\\nrushing across the dirt floor in the faint light.... Near us \
about\\nfifty men were left stranded, stubbornly in favour, and even as \
the\\nhigh roof shook under the shock of victorious roaring, they \
turned\\nand rapidly walked out of the building--and, some of them, out of \
the\\nRevolution....\\n\\nImagine this struggle being repeated in every \
barracks of the city,\\nthe district, the whole front, all Russia. Imagine \
the sleepless\\nKrylenkos, watching the regiments, hurrying from place to \
place,\\narguing, threatening, entreating. And then imaging the same in \
all\\nthe locals of every labour union, in the factories, the villages, \
on\\nthe battle-ships of the far-flung Russian fleets; think of \
the\\nhundreds of thousands of Russian men staring up at speakers all \
over\\nthe vast country, workmen, peasants, soldiers, sailors, trying \
so\\nhard to understand and to choose, thinking so intensely--and \
deciding\\nso unanimously at the end. So was the Russian \
Revolution....\\n\\nUp at Smolny the new Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars was not idle.\\nAlready the first decree was on the presses, to be \
circulated in\\nthousands through the city streets that night, and shipped in \
bales\\nby every train southward and east:\\n\\nIn the name of the Government \
of the Russian Republic, chosen by the\\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies\\nwith \
participation of peasant deputies, the Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars decrees:\\n\\n1. The elections for the \
Constituent Assembly shall take place at\\nthe date determined upon--November \
12.\\n\\n2. All electoral commissions, organs of local \
self-government,\\nSoviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, and soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\norganisations on the front should make every effort to \
assure free\\nand regular elections at the date determined upon.\\n\\nIn the \
name of the Government of the Russian Republic, _The\\nPresident of the \
Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars_,\\n\\nVLADIMIR \
ULIANOV-LENIN.\\n\\nIn the Municipal building the Duma was in full blast. A \
member of\\nthe Council of the Republic was talking as we came in. The \
Council,\\nhe said, did not consider itself dissolved at all, but merely \
unable\\nto continue its labours until it secured a new meeting-place. In the\
\\nmeanwhile, its Committee of Elders had determined to enter _en\\nmasse_ \
the Committee for Salvation.... This, I may remark\\nparenthetically, is the \
last time history mentions the Council of\\nthe Russian \
Republic....\\n\\nThen followed the customary string of delegates from the \
Ministries,\\nthe _Vikzhel,_ the Union of Posts and Telegraphs, for the \
hundredth\\ntime reiterating their determination not to work for the \
Bolshevik\\nusurpers. A _yunker_ who had been in the Winter Palace told \
a\\nhighly-coloured tale of the heroism of himself and his comrades, \
and\\ndisgraceful conduct of the Red Guards--all of which was \
devoutly\\nbelieved. Somebody read aloud an account in the \
Socialist\\nRevolutionary paper _Narod,_ which stated that five hundred \
million\\nrubles\[CloseCurlyQuote] worth of damage had been done in the \
Winter Palace, and\\ndescribing in great detail the loot and \
breakage.\\n\\nFrom time to time couriers came from the telephone with news. \
The\\nfour Socialist Ministers had been released from prison. Krylenko \
had\\ngone to Peter-Paul to tell Admiral Verderevsky that the Ministry \
of\\nMarine was deserted, and to beg him, for the sake of Russia, to \
take\\ncharge under the authority of the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars;\\nand the old seaman had consented.... Kerensky was advancing \
north from\\nGatchina, the Bolshevik garrisons falling back before him. \
Smolny\\nhad issued another decree, enlarging the powers of the City Dumas to\
\\ndeal with food supplies.\\n\\nThis last piece of insolence caused an \
outburst of fury. He, Lenin,\\nthe usurper, the tyrant, whose Commissars had \
seized the Municipal\\ngarage, entered the Municipal ware houses, were \
interfering with the\\nSupply Committees and the distribution of food--he \
presumed to define\\nthe limits of power of the free, independent, autonomous \
City\\nGovernment! One member, shaking his fist, moved to cut off the \
food\\nof the city if the Bolsheviki dared to interfere with the \
Supply\\nCommittees.... Another, representative of the Special \
Supply\\nCommittee, reported that the food situation was very grave, \
and\\nasked that emissaries be sent out to hasten food \
trains.\\n\\nDiedonenko announced dramatically that the garrison was \
wavering.\\nThe Semionovsky regiment had already decided to submit to the \
orders\\nof the Socialist Revolutionary party; the crews of the torpedo-boats\
\\non the Neva were shaky. Seven members were at once appointed to\\ncontinue \
the propaganda....\\n\\nThen the old Mayor stepped into the tribune: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades and citizens!\\nI have just learned that the \
prisoners in Peter Paul are in danger.\\nFourteen _yunkers_ of the Pavlovsk \
school have been stripped and\\ntortured by the Bolshevik guards. One has \
gone mad. They are\\nthreatening to lynch the Ministers!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] There was a whirlwind of\\nindignation and horror, \
which only grew more violent when a stocky\\nlittle woman dressed in grey \
demanded the floor, and lifted up her\\nhard, metallic voice. This was Vera \
Slutskaya, veteran revolutionist\\nand Bolshevik member of the Duma.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That is a lie and a provocation!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she said, unmoved at the torrent\\nof abuse. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government, which has\\nabolished the death penalty, \
cannot permit such deeds. We demand\\nthat this story be investigated, at \
once; if there is any truth in\\nit, the Government will take energetic \
measures!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA commission composed of members of \
all parties was immediately\\nappointed, and with the Mayor, sent to Peter \
Paul to investigate. As\\nwe followed them out, the Duma was appointing \
another commission to\\nmeet Kerensky--to try and avoid bloodshed when he \
entered the\\ncapital....\\n\\nIt was midnight when we bluffed our past the \
guards at the gate of\\nthe fortress, and went forward under the faint \
glimmer of rare\\nelectric lights along the side of the church where lie the \
tombs of\\nthe Tsars, beneath the slender golden spire and the chimes, which,\
\\nfor months, continued to play _Bozhe Tsaria Khrani_[17] every day \
at\\nnoon.... The place was deserted; in most of the windows there were \
not\\neven lights. Occasionally we bumped into a burly figure stumbling along\
\\nin the dark, who answered questions with the usual, _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ya nieznayu.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n\\n[17] \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]God Save the \
Tsar.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n[Graphic, page 166: Pass to Reed from \

6th of November, 1917.\\n        No. 213\\n  Petrograd, Smolny\\n  Institute, \

American Socialist press, JOHN REED, to\\nvisit all places of confinement in \
the cities of Petrograd and\\nCronstadt, for the purpose of generally \
investigating the condition\\nof the prisoners, and for thorough social \
information for the\\npurpose of stopping the flood of newspaper lies against \
demorcracy.\\n       Chief Commissar\\n       Secretary\\n\\nOn the left \
loomed the low dark outline of Trubetskoi Bastion, that\\nliving grave in \
which so many martyrs of liberty had lost their\\nlives or their reason in \
the days of the Tsar, where the Provisional\\nGovernment had in turn shut up \
the Ministers of the Tsar, and now\\nthe Bolsheviki had shut up the Ministers \
of the Provisional\\nGovernment.\\n\\nA friendly sailor led us to the office \
of the commandant, in a\\nlittle house near the Mint. Half a dozen Red \
Guards, sailors and\\nsoldiers were sitting around a hot room full of smoke, \
in which a\\nsamovar steamed cheerfully. They welcomed us with great \
cordiality,\\noffering tea. The commandant was not in; he was escorting \
a\\ncommission of \
_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]sabotazhniki\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ (sabotageurs) \
from the City Duma, who\\ninsisted that the _yunkers_ were all being \
murdered. This seemed to\\namuse them very much. At one side of the room sat \
a bald-headed,\\ndissipated-looking little man in a frock-coat and a rich fur \
coat,\\nbiting his moustache and staring around him like a cornered rat. \
He\\nhad just been arrested. Somebody said, glancing carelessly at \
him,\\nthat he was a Minister or something.... The little man didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t seem to\\nhear it; he was evidently terrified, although \
the occupants of the\\nroom showed no animosity whatever toward him.\\n\\nI \
went across and spoke to him in French. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Count Tolstoy,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nanswered, bowing stiffly. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I do not understand why I was arrested. I\\nwas \
crossing the Troitsky Bridge on my way home when two of \
these--of\\nthese--persons held me up. I was a Commissar of the \
Provisional\\nGovernment attached to the General Staff, but in no sense a \
member\\nof the Government...\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let him go,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said a sailor. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s harmless....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] responded the soldier who had brought the prisoner. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must\\nask the \
commandant.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, the \
commandant!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] sneered the sailor. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What did you make a\\nrevolution for? To go on obeying \
officers?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA _praporshtchik_ of the Pavlovsky \
regiment was telling us how the\\ninsurrection started. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The _polk_ (regiment) was on duty at the\\nGeneral \
Staff the night of the 6th. Some of my comrades and I were\\nstanding guard; \
Ivan Pavlovitch and another man--I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t remember \
his\\nname--well, they hid behind the window-curtains in the room where \
the\\nStaff was having a meeting, and they heard a great many things. \
For\\nexample, they heard orders to bring the Gatchina _yunkers_ \
to\\nPetrograd by night, and an order for the Cossacks to be ready to\\nmarch \
in the morning.... The principal points in the city were to be\\noccupied \
before dawn. Then there was the business of opening the\\nbridges. But when \
they began to talk about surrounding Smolny, then\\nIvan Pavlovitch couldn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stand it any longer. That minute there was\\na good deal \
of coming and going, so he slipped out and came down to\\nthe guard-room, \
leaving the other comrade to pick up what he could.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I was already suspicious that something was going on. \
Automobiles\\nfull of officers kept coming, and all the Ministers were there. \
Ivan\\nPavlovitch told me what he had heard. It was half-past two in \
the\\nmorning. The secretary of the regimental Committee was there, so \
we\\ntold him and asked what to do.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Arrest everybody coming and going!\[CloseCurlyQuote] he \
says. So we began to do\\nit. In an hour we had some officers and a couple of \
Ministers, whom\\nwe sent up to Smolny right away. But the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t ready; they didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know what to do; and pretty soon\\nback came the order to \
let everybody go and not arrest anybody else.\\nWell, we ran all the way to \
Smolny, and I guess we talked for an\\nhour before they finally saw that it \
was war. It was five o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock\\nwhen we got back to the \
Staff, and by that time most of them were\\ngone. But we got a few, and the \
garrison was all on the march....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA Red Guard \
from Vasili Ostrov described in great detail what had\\nhappened in his \
district on the great day of the rising. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nhave any machine-guns over there,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, laughing, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]and \
we\\ncouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get any from Smolny. Comrade Zalking, who was \
a member of\\nthe _Uprava_ (Central Bureau) of the Ward Duma, remembered all \
at\\nonce that there was lying in the meeting-room of the _Uprava_ \
a\\nmachinegun which had been captured from the Germans. So he and I \
and\\nanother comrade went there. The Mensheviki and \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries were having a meeting. Well, we opened the door \
and\\nwalked right in on them, as they sat around the table--twelve \
or\\nfifteen of them, three of us. When they saw us they stopped \
talking\\nand just stared. We walked right across the room, uncoupled \
the\\nmachine-gun; Comrade Zalkind picked up one part, I the other, we \
put\\nthem on our shoulders and walked out--and not a single man said \
a\\nword!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do you know how \
the Winter Palace was captured?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked a third \
man,\\na sailor. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Along about eleven \
o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock we found out there weren\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
any\\nmore _yunkers_ on the Neva side. So we broke in the doors \
and\\nfiltered up the different stairways one by one, or in little\\nbunches. \
When we got to the top of the stairs the _yunkers_ held us\\nup and took away \
our guns. Still our fellows kept coming up, little\\nby little, until we had \
a majority. Then we turned around and took\\naway the _yunkers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]_ guns....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nJust then the \
commandant entered--a merry-looking young\\nnon-commissioned officer with his \
arm in a sling, and deep circles\\nof sleeplessness under his eyes. His eye \
fell first on the prisoner,\\nwho at once began to explain.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, yes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] interrupted the \
other. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You were one of the committee who\\nrefused to \
surrender the Staff Wednesday afternoon. However, we\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
want you, citizen. Apologies--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He opened the door and \
waved\\nhis arm for Count Tolstoy to leave. Several of the \
others,\\nespecially the Red Guards, grumbled protests, and the \
sailor\\nremarked triumphantly, _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Vot!_ There! Didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t I say so?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTwo soldiers now \
engaged his attention. They had been elected a\\ncommittee of the fortress \
garrison to protest. The prisoners, they\\nsaid, were getting the same food \
as the guards, when there wasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\neven enough to keep a man \
from being hungry. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why should \
the\\ncounter-revolutionists be treated so \
well?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are \
revolutionists, comrades, not bandits,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered \
the\\ncommandant. He turned to us. We explained that rumours were \
going\\nabout that the _yunkers_ were being tortured, and the lives of \
the\\nMinisters threatened. Could we perhaps see the prisoners, so as to\\nbe \
able to prove to the world--?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the young soldier, \
irritably. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am not going to disturb\\nthe prisoners \
again. I have just been compelled to wake them up--they\\nwere sure we were \
going to massacre them.... Most of the _yunkers_\\nhave been released anyway, \
and the rest will go out to-morrow.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He\\nturned \
abruptly away.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Could we talk to the Duma \
commission, then?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Commandant, who was \
pouring himself a glass of tea, nodded.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They are \
still out in the hall,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said \
carelessly.\\n\\nIndeed they stood there just outside the door, in the feeble \
light\\nof an oil lamp, grouped around the Mayor and talking excitedly.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mr. Mayor,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we are American correspondents. Will you\\nplease tell \
us officially the result of your \
investigations?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe turned to us his face of \
venerable dignity.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is no truth in the \
reports,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said slowly. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Except for the\\nincidents which occurred as the \
Ministers were being brought here,\\nthey have been treated with every \
consideration. As for the\\n_yunkers,_ not one has received the slightest \
injury....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nUp the Nevsky, in the empty \
after-midnight gloom, an interminable\\ncolumn of soldiers shuffled in \
silence--to battle with Kerensky. In\\ndim back streets automobiles without \
lights flitted to and fro, and\\nthere was furtive activity in Fontanka 6, \
headquarters of the\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviet, in a certain \
apartment of a huge building on the\\nNevsky, and in the _Injinierny Zamok_ \
(School of Engineers); the\\nDuma was illuminated....\\n\\nIn Smolny \
Institute the Military Revolutionary Committee flashed\\nbaleful fire, \
pounding like an over-loaded dynamo....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter VII\\n\\nThe \
Revolutionary Front\\n\\n\\nSaturday, November \
10th....\\n\\nCitizens!\\n\\nThe Military Revolutionary Committee declares \
that it will not\\ntolerate any violation of revolutionary \
order....\\n\\nTheft, brigandage, assaults and attempts at massacre will \
be\\nseverely punished....\\n\\nFollowing the example of the Paris Commune, \
the Committee will\\ndestroy without mercy any looter or instigator of \
disorder....\\n\\nQuiet lay the city. Not a hold-up, not a robbery, not even \
a drunken\\nfight. By night armed patrols went through the silent streets, \
and\\non the corners soldiers and Red Guards squatted around little \
fires,\\nlaughing and singing. In the daytime great crowds gathered on \
the\\nsidewalks listening to interminable hot debates between students \
and\\nsoldiers, business men and workmen.\\n\\nCitizens stopped each other on \
the street.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Cossacks are coming?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
the latest?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know anything. Where\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Kerensky?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They say only eight \
versts from Petrograd.... Is it true that the\\nBolsheviki have fled to the \
battleship _Avrora?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They \
say so....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOnly the walls screamed, and the few \
newspapers; denunciation,\\nappeal, decree....\\n\\nAn enormous poster \
carried the hysterical manifesto of the Executive\\nCommittee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets:\\n\\n....They (the Bolsheviki) dare to say that \
they are supported by the\\nSoviets of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, \
and that they are speaking on behalf\\nof the Soviets of Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies....\\n\\nLet all working-class Russia know that \
this is a LIE, AND THAT ALL\\nTHE WORKING PEASANTS--in the person of--the \
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE\\nALL-RUSSIAN SOVIETS OF \
PEASANTS\[CloseCurlyQuote] DEPUTIES--refutes with indignation\\nall \
participation of the organised peasantry in this criminal\\nviolation of the \
will of the working-classes....\\n\\nFrom the Soldier Section of the \
Socialist Revolutionary party:\\n\\nThe insane attempt of the Bolsheviki is \
on the eve of collapse. The\\ngarrison is divided.... The Ministries are on \
strike and bread is\\ngetting scarcer. All factions except the few Bolsheviki \
have left\\nthe Congress. The Bolsheviki are alone....\\n\\nWe call upon all \
sane elements to group themselves around the\\nCommittee for Salvation of \
Country and Revolution, and to prepare\\nthemselves seriously to be ready at \
the first call of the Central\\nCommittee....\\n\\nIn a hand-bill the Council \
of the Republic recited its wrongs:\\n\\nCeding to the force of bayonets, the \
Council of the Republic has\\nbeen obliged to separate, and temporarily to \
interrupt its meetings.\\n\\nThe usurpers, with the words \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Liberty and Socialism\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] on their \
lips,\\nhave set up a rule of arbitrary violence. They have arrested \
the\\nmembers of the Provisional Government, closed the newspapers, \
seized\\nthe printing-shops....This power must be considered the enemy of the\
\\npeople and the Revolution; it is necessary to do battle with it, and\\nto \
pull it down....\\n\\nThe Council of the Republic, until the resumption of \
its labours,\\ninvites the citizens of the Russian Republic to group \
themselves\\naround the....local Committees for Salvation of Country \
and\\nRevolution, which are organising the overthrow of the Bolsheviki \
and\\nthe creation of a Government capable of leading the country to \
the\\nConstituent Assembly.\\n\\n_Dielo Naroda_ said:\\n\\nA revolution is a \
rising of all the people.... But here what have we?\\nNothing but a handful \
of poor fools deceived by Lenin and Trotzky....\\nTheir decrees and their \
appeals will simply add to the museum of\\nhistorical \
curiosities....\\n\\nAnd _Narodnoye Slovo_(People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Word-Populist Socialist):\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] That is only a pipedream;\\nnobody, either in Russia \
or in the countries of our Allies, will\\nrecognise this \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Government\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--or even in the \
enemy countries....\\n\\nThe bourgeois press had temporarily \
disappeared...._Pravada_ had an\\naccount of the first meeting of the new \
_Tsay-ee-kah,_ now the\\nparliament of the Russian Soviet Republic. Miliutin, \
Commissar of\\nAgriculture, remarked that the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Executive Committee had\\ncalled an All-Russian Peasant Congress for December \
13th.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But we cannot wait,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must have the backing of the\\npeasants. I \
propose that _we_ call the Congress of Peasants, and do\\nit immediately....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The Left Socialist Revolutionaries agreed. \
An\\nAppeal to the Peasants of Russia was hastily drafted, and a\\ncommittee \
of five elected to carry out the project.\\n\\nThe question of detailed plans \
for distributing the land, and the\\nquestion of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Control of Industry, were postponed until the\\nexperts working on them \
should submit a report.\\n\\nThree decrees (See App. VII, Sect. 1) were read \
and approved: first,\\nLenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]General Rules For the Press,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
ordering the suppression of\\nall newspapers inciting to resistance and \
disobedience to the new\\nGovernment, inciting to criminal acts, or \
deliberately perverting\\nthe news; the Decree of Moratorium for House-rents; \
and the Decree\\nEstablishing a Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Militia. Also \
orders, one giving the\\nMunicipal Duma power to requisition empty apartments \
and houses, the\\nother directing the unloading of freight cars in the \
railroad\\nterminals, to hasten the distribution of necessities and to free \
the\\nbadly-needed rolling-stock....\\n\\nTwo hours later the Executive \
Committee of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets was\\nsending broadcast \
over Russia the following telegram:\\n\\nThe arbitrary organisation of the \
Bolsheviki, which is called\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bureau of Organisation \
for the National Congress of Peasants,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is\\ninviting \
all the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets to send delegates to the \
Congress\\nat Petrograd....\\n\\nThe Executive Committee of the Soviets of \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies\\ndeclares that it considers, now as well \
as before, that it would be\\ndangerous to take away from the provinces at \
this moment the forces\\nnecessary to prepare for elections to the \
Constituent Assembly,\\nwhich is the only salvation of the working-class and \
the country. We\\nconfirm the date of the Congress of Peasants, _December \
13th._\\n\\nAt the Duma all was excitement, officers coming and going, the \
Mayor\\nin conference with the leaders of the Committee for Salvation. \
A\\nCouncillor ran in with a copy of Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
proclamation, dropped by\\nhundreds from an aeroplane low flying down the \
Nevsky, which\\nthreatened terrible vengeance on all who did not submit, and \
ordered\\nsoldiers to lay down their arms and assemble immediately in \
Mars\\nField.\\n\\nThe Minister-President had taken Tsarskoye Selo, we were \
told, and\\nwas already in the Petrograd campagna, five miles away. He \
would\\nenter the city to-morrow--in a few hours. The Soviet troops \
in\\ncontact with his Cossacks were said to be going over to \
the\\nProvisional Government. Tchernov was somewhere in between, trying \
to\\norganise the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]neutral\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
troops into a force to halt the civil war.\\n\\nIn the city the garrison \
regiments were leaving the Bolsheviki, they\\nsaid. Smolny was already \
abandoned.... All the Governmental machinery\\nhad stopped functioning. The \
employees of the State Bank had refused\\nto work under Commissars from \
Smolny, refused to pay out money to\\nthem. All the private banks were \
closed. The Ministries were on\\nstrike. Even now a committee from the Duma \
was making the rounds of\\nbusiness houses, collecting a fund to pay the \
salaries of the\\nstrikers....\\n\\nTrotzky had gone to the Ministry of \
Foreign Affairs and ordered the\\nclerks to translate the Decree on Peace \
into foreign languages; six\\nhundred functionaries had hurled their \
resignations in his face....\\nShliapnikov, Commissar of Labour, had \
commanded all the employees of\\nhis Ministry to return to their places \
within twenty-four hours, or\\nlose their places and their pension-rights; \
only the door-servants\\nhad responded.... Some of the branches of the \
Special Food Supply\\nCommittee had suspended work rather than submit to the \
Bolsheviki....\\nIn spite of lavish promises of high wages and better \
conditions, the\\noperators at the Telephone Exchange would not connect \
Soviet\\nheadquarters....\\n\\nThe Socialist Revolutionary Party had voted to \
expel all members who\\nhad remained in the Congress of Soviets, and all who \
were taking\\npart in the insurrection....\\n\\nNews from the provinces. \
Moghilev had declared against the\\nBolsheviki. At Kiev the Cossacks had \
overthrown the Soviets and\\narrested all the insurrectionary leaders. The \
Soviet and garrison of\\nLuga, thirty thousand strong, affirmed its loyalty \
to the\\nProvisional Government, and appealed to all Russia to rally \
around\\nit. Kaledin had dispersed all Soviets and Unions in the Don \
Basin,\\nand his forces were moving north....\\n\\nSaid a representative of \
the Railway Workers: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yesterday we sent a\\ntelegram \
all over Russia demanding that war between the political\\nparties cease at \
once, and insisting on the formation of a coalition\\nSocialist Government. \
Otherwise we shall call a strike to-morrow\\nnight.... In the morning there \
will be a meeting of all factions to\\nconsider the question. The Bolsheviki \
seem anxious for an\\nagreement....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If they last that long!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
laughed the City Engineer, a stout, ruddy\\nman....\\n\\nAs we came up to \
Smolny--not abandoned, but busier than ever, throngs\\nof workers and \
soldiers running in and out, and doubled guards\\neverywhere--we met the \
reporters for the bourgeois and \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nSocialist \
papers.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Threw us out!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
cried one, from _Volia Naroda._ \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bonch-Bruevitch\\ncame \
down to the Press Bureau and told us to leave! Said we were\\nspies!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] They all began to talk at once: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Insult! Outrage! Freedom of\\nthe press!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the lobby were great tables heaped with \
stacks of appeals,\\nproclamations and orders of the Military Revolutionary \
Committee.\\nWorkmen and soldiers staggered past, carrying them to \
waiting\\nautomobiles.\\n\\nOne began:\\n\\nTO THE PILLORY!\\n\\nIn this \
tragic moment through which the Russian masses are living,\\nthe Mensheviki \
and their followers and the Right Socialist\\nRevolutionaries have betrayed \
the working-class. They have enlisted\\non the side of Kornilov, Kerensky and \
Savinkov....\\n\\nThey are printing orders of the traitor Kerensky and \
creating a\\npanic in the city, spreading the most ridiculous rumours of \
mythical\\nvictories by that renegade....\\n\\nCitizens! \
Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe these false rumours. No power can defeat \
the\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Revolution.... Premier Kerensky and his \
followers await\\nspeedy and well-deserved punishment....\\n\\nWe are putting \
them in the Pillory. We are abandoning them to the\\nenmity of all workers, \
soldiers, sailors and peasants, on whom they\\nare trying to rivet the \
ancient chains. They will never be able to\\nwash from their bodies the stain \
of the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hatred and contempt.\\n\\nShame and curses \
to the traitors of the People!...\\n\\nThe Military Revolutionary Committee \
had moved into larger quarters,\\nroom 17 on the top floor. Red Guards were \
at the door. Inside, the\\nnarrow space in front of the railing was crowded \
with well-dressed\\npersons, outwardly respectful but inwardly full of \
murder--bourgeois\\nwho wanted permits for their automobiles, or passports to \
leave the\\ncity, among them many foreigners.... Bill Shatov and Peters were \
on\\nduty. They suspended all other business to read us the \
latest\\nbulletins.\\n\\nThe One Hundred Seventy-ninth Reserve Regiment \
offers its unanimous\\nsupport. Five thousand stevedores at the Putilov \
wharves greet the\\nnew Government. Central Committee of the Trade \
Unions--enthusiastic\\nsupport. The garrison and squadron at Reval elect \
Military\\nRevolutionary Committees to cooperate, and despatch troops. \
Military\\nRevolutionary Committees control in Pskov and Minsk. Greetings \
from\\nthe Soviets of Tsaritzin, Rovensky-on-Don, \
Tchernogorsk,\\nSevastopol.... The Finland Division, the new Committees of \
the Fifth\\nand Twelfth Armies, offer allegiance....\\n\\nFrom Moscow the \
news is uncertain. Troops of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee occupy \
the strategic points of the city; two\\ncompanies on duty in the Kremlin have \
gone over to the Soviets, but\\nthe Arsenal is in the hands of Colonel \
Diabtsev and his _yunkers._\\nThe Revolutionary Committee demanded arms for \
the workers, and\\nRiabtsev parleyed with them until this morning, when \
suddenly he\\nsent an ultimatum to the Committee, ordering Soviet troops \
to\\nsurrender and the Committee to disband. Fighting has begun....\\n\\nIn \
Petrograd the Staff submitted to Smolny\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars at \
once. The\\n_Tsentroflot,_ refusing, was stormed by Dybenko and a company \
of\\nCronstadt sailors, and a new _Tsentroflot_ set up, supported by \
the\\nBaltic and the Black Sea battleships....\\n\\nBut beneath all the \
breezy assurance there was a chill premonition,\\na feeling of uneasiness in \
the air. Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Cossacks were coming\\nfast; they had \
artillery. Skripnik, Secretary of the Factory-Shop\\nCommittees, his face \
drawn and yellow, assured me that there was a\\nwhole army corps of them, but \
he added, fiercely, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll \
never\\ntake us alive!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Petrovsky laughed weariedly, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To-morrow maybe we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll\\nget a \
sleep--a long one....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Lozovsky, with his emaciated, \
red-bearded\\nface, said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What chance have we? All \
alone.... A mob against \
trained\\nsoldiers!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSouth and south-west the \
Soviets had fled before Kerensky, and the\\ngarrisons of Gatchina, Pavlovsk, \
Tsarskoye Selo were divided--half\\nvoting to remain neutral, the rest, \
without officers, falling back\\non the capital in the wildest \
disorder.\\n\\nIn the halls they were pasting up bulletins:\\n\\nFROM \
KRASNOYE SELO, NOVEMBER 10TH, 8 A.M.\\n\\n_To be communicated to all \
Commanders of Staffs, Commanders in\\nChief, Commanders, everywhere and to \
all, all, all._\\n\\nThe ex-Minister Kerensky has sent a deliberately false \
telegram to\\nevery one everywhere to the effect that the troops of \
revolutionary\\nPetrograd have voluntarily surrendered their arms and joined \
the\\narmies of the former Government, the Government of Treason, and \
that\\nthe soldiers have been ordered by the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee to retreat. The troops of a free people do not \
retreat nor\\ndo they surrender.\\n\\nOur troops have left Gatchina in order \
to avoid bloodshed between\\nthemselves and their mistaken brother-Cossacks, \
and in order to take\\na more convenient position, which is at present so \
strong that if\\nKerensky and his companions in arms should even increase \
their\\nforces ten times, still there would be no cause for anxiety. \
The\\nspirit of our troops is excellent.\\n\\nIn Petrograd all is \
quiet.\\n\\n_Chief of the Defence of Petrograd and the Petrograd \
District,_\\n\\nLieutenant-Colonel Muraviov.\\n\\nAs we left the Military \

a corpse.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Send this,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said \
he.\\n\\nTO ALL DISTRICT SOVIETS OF WORKERS\[CloseCurlyQuote] DEPUTIES AND \
FACTORYSHOP\\nCOMMITTEES\\n\\nThe Kornilovist bands of Kerensky are \
threatening the approaches to\\nthe capital. All the necessary orders have \
been given to crush\\nmercilessly the counter-revolutionary attempt against \
the people and\\nits conquests.\\n\\nThe Army and the Red Guard of the \
Revolution are in need of the\\nimmediate support of the workers.\\n\\nWE \
ORDER THE WARD SOVIETS AND FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES:\\n\\n1. To move out the \
greatest possible number of workers for the\\ndigging of trenches, the \
erection of barricades and reinforcing of\\nwire entanglements.\\n\\n2. \
Wherever it shall be necessary for this purpose to stop work at\\nthe \
factories this shall be done immediately.\\n\\n3. All common and barbed wire \
available must be assembled, and also\\nall implements for the digging of \
trenches and the erection of\\nbarricades.\\n\\n4. All available arms must be \
taken.\\n\\n5. THE STRICTEST DISCIPLINE IS TO BE OBSERVED, AND EVERY ONE MUST \
BE\\nREADY TO SUPPORT THE ARMY OF THE REVOLUTION BY ALL MEANS.\\n\\n_Chairman \
of the Petrograd Soviet of Worker\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies,_\\n\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar LEON \
TROTZKY.\\n\\n_Chairman of the Military Revolutionary \
Committee,_\\n\\nCommander in Chief PODVOISKY.\\n\\nAs we came out into the \
dark and gloomy day all around the grey\\nhorizon factory whistles were \
blowing, a hoarse and nervous sound,\\nfull of foreboding. By tens of \
thousands the working-people poured\\nout, men and women; by tens of \
thousands the humming slums belched\\nout their dun and miserable hordes. Red \
Petrograd was in danger!\\nCossacks! South and southwest they poured through \
the shabby streets\\ntoward the Moskovsky Gate, men, women and children, with \
rifles,\\npicks, spades, rolls of wire, cartridge-belts over their \
working\\nclothes.... Such an immense, spontaneous outpouring of a city never\
\\nwas seen! They rolled along torrent-like, companies of soldiers\\nborne \
with them, guns, motor-trucks, wagons--the revolutionary\\nproletariat \
defending with its breast the capital of the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Republic!\\n\\nBefore the door of Smolny was an \
automobile. A slight man with thick\\nglasses magnifying his red-rimmed eyes, \
his speech a painful effort,\\nstood leaning against a mud-guard with his \
hands in the pockets of a\\nshabby raglan. A great bearded sailor, with the \
clear eyes of youth,\\nprowled restlessly about, absently toying with an \
enormous\\nblue-steel revolver, which never left his hand. These were Antonov\
\\nand Dybenko.\\n\\nSome soldiers were trying to fasten two military \
bicycles on the\\nrunning-board. The chauffeur violently protested; the \
enamel would\\nget scratched, he said. True, he was a Bolshevik, and the \
automobile\\nwas commandeered from a bourgeois; true, the bicycles were for \
the\\nuse of orderlies. But the chauffeur\[CloseCurlyQuote]s professional \
pride was\\nrevolted.... So the bicycles were abandoned....\\n\\nThe People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars for War and Marine were going to inspect \
the\\nrevolutionary front--wherever that was. Could we go with \
them?\\nCertainly not. The automobile only held five--the two Commissars, two\
\\norderlies and the chauffeur. However, a Russian acquaintance of\\nmine, \
whom I will call Trusishka, calmly got in and sat down, nor\\ncould any \
argument dislodge him....\\n\\nI see no reason to doubt Trusishka\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s story of the journey. As they\\nwent down the Suvorovsky \
Prospect some one mentioned food. They\\nmight be out three or four days, in \
a country indifferently well\\nprovisioned. They stopped the car. Money? The \
Commissar of War\\nlooked through his pockets--he hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t a \
kopek. The Commissar of\\nMarine was broke. So was the chauffeur. Trusishka \
bought the\\nprovisions....\\n\\nJust as they turned into the Nevsky a tire \
blew out.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What shall we do?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked \
Antonov.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Commandeer another machine!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] suggested Dybenko, waving his\\nrevolver. Antonov \
stood in the middle of the street and signalled a\\npassing machine, driven \
by a soldier.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I want that machine,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Antonov.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You won\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get it,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] responded the soldier.\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do you know who I am?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Antonov produced a paper upon which was\\nwritten that he had been appointed \
Commander-in-Chief of all the\\narmies of the Russian Republic, and that \
every one should obey him\\nwithout question.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t care if you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re the devil himself,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the soldier, \
hotly.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This machine belongs to the First Machine-Gun \
Regiment, and we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re\\ncarrying ammunition in it, and you can\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have it....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe difficulty, \
however, was solved by the appearance of an old\\nbattered taxi-cab, flying \
the Italian flag. (In time of trouble\\nprivate cars were registered in the \
name of foreign consulates, so\\nas to be safe from requisition.) From the \
interior of this was\\ndislodged a fat citizen in an expensive fur coat, and \
the party\\ncontinued on its way.\\n\\nArrived at Narvskaya Zastava, about \
ten miles out, Antonov called\\nfor the commandant of the Red Guard. He was \
led to the edge of the\\ntown, where some few hundred workmen had dug \
trenches and were\\nwaiting for the \
Cossacks.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Everything all right here, comrade?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked \
Antonov.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Everything perfect, comrade,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the \
commandant.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The troops are in excellent \
spirits.... Only one thing--we have no\\nammunition....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In Smolny there are two \
billion rounds,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Antonov told him. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I will\\ngive you an order.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He \
felt in his pockets. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Has any one a piece of\\npaper?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDybenko had none--nor the couriers. Trusishka \
had to offer his\\nnote-book....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Devil! I have no \
pencil!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried Antonov. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s got a pencil?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nNeedless to say, \
Trusishka had the only pencil in the crowd....\\n\\nWe who were left behind \
made for the Tsarskoye Selo station. Up the\\nNevsky, as we passed, Red \
Guards were marching, all armed, some with\\nbayonets and some without. The \
early twilight of winter was falling.\\nHeads up they tramped in the chill \
mud, irregular lines of four,\\nwithout music, without drums. A red flag \
crudely lettered in gold,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Peace! Land!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] floated over them. They were very young. \
The\\nexpression on their faces was that of who know they are going \
to\\ndie.... Half-fearful, half-contemptuous, the crowds on the \
sidewalk\\nwatched them pass, in hateful silence....\\n\\n[Graphic, page 184: \
Pass to the Northern Front]\\n\\nThis pass was issued upon the recommendation \
of Trotzky three days\\nafter the Bolshevik Revolution. It gives me the right \
of free travel\\nto the Northern front--and an added note on the back extends \
the\\npermission to all fronts. It will be noticed that the speaks of \
the\\n_Petersburg_, instead of the _Petrograd_ Soviet; it was the \
fashion\\namong thorough-going internationalists to abolish all names \
which\\nsmacked of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]patriotism\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; \
but at the same time, it would not do to\\nrestore the \

him the right of free travel\\nthrough the entire Northern front, for the \
purpose of reporting to\\nour American comrades--internationalists concerning \

                      For the Secretary\\n\\nAt the railroad station nobody \
knew just where Kerensky was, or\\nwhere the front lay. Trains went no \
further, however, than\\nTsarskoye....\\n\\nOur car was full of commuters and \
country people going home, laden\\nwith bundles and evening papers. The talk \
was all of the Bolshevik\\nrising. Outside of that, however, one would never \
have realised that\\ncivil war was rending mighty Russia in two, and that the \
train was\\nheaded into the zone of battle. Through the window we could see, \
in\\nthe swiftly-deepening darkness, masses of soldiers going along \
the\\nmuddy road toward the city, flinging out their arms in argument. \
A\\nfreight-train, swarming with troops and lit up by huge bonfires, \
was\\nhalted on a siding. That was all. Back along the flat horizon \
the\\nglow of the city\[CloseCurlyQuote]s lights faded down the night. A \
street-car crawled\\ndistantly along a far-flung suburb....\\n\\nTsarskoye \
Selo station was quiet, but knots of soldiers stood here\\nand there talking \
in low tones and looking uneasily down the empty\\ntrack in the direction of \
Gatchina. I asked some of them which side\\nthey were on. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said one, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t exactly know the rights \
of\\nthe matter.... There is no doubt that Kerensky is a provocator, but \
we\\ndo not consider it right for Russian men to be shooting Russian men.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the station commandant\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
office was a big, jovial, bearded common\\nsoldier, wearing the red arm-band \
of a regimental committee. Our\\ncredentials from Smolny commanded immediate \
respect. He was plainly\\nfor the Soviets, but bewildered.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Red Guards were here two hours ago, but they went \
away again. A\\nCommissar came this morning, but he returned to Petrograd \
when the\\nCossacks arrived.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Cossacks are here then?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\nHe nodded, gloomily. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There has been a battle. The \
Cossacks came\\nearly in the morning. They captured two or three hundred of \
our men,\\nand killed about twenty-five.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where are the Cossacks?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, they didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get this far. I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know just where they are.\\nOff that way....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He waved his arm vaguely westward.\\n\\nWe had \
dinner--an excellent dinner, better and cheaper than could be\\ngot in \
Petrograd--in the station restaurant. Nearby sat a French\\nofficer who had \
just come on foot from Gatchina. All was quiet\\nthere, he said. Kerensky \
held the town. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah, these Russians,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nwent on, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they are \
original! What a civil war! Everything except the\\nfighting!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe sallied out into the town. Just at the door \
of the station stood\\ntwo soldiers with rifles and bayonets fixed. They were \
surrounded by\\nabout a hundred business men, Government officials and \
students, who\\nattacked them with passionate argument and epithet. The \
soldiers\\nwere uncomfortable and hurt, like children unjustly \
scolded.\\n\\nA tall young man with a supercilious expression, dressed in the\
\\nuniform of a student, was leading the \
attack.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You realise, I presume,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said insolently, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that by \
taking up\\narms against your brothers you are making yourselves the tools of\
\\nmurderers and traitors?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now brother,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the \
soldier earnestly, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]you don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
understand.\\nThere are two classes, don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you see, the \
proletariat and the\\nbourgeoisie. We--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, I know that silly talk!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
broke in the student rudely. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A bunch\\nof ignorant \
peasants like you hear somebody bawling a few\\ncatch-words. You don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t understand what they mean. You just echo them\\nlike a \
lot of parrots.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The crowd laughed. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m a Marxian student.\\nAnd I tell \
you that this isn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t Socialism you are fighting for. It\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\njust plain pro-German \
anarchy!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, yes, I know,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the soldier, with sweat dripping from\\nhis \
brow. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are an educated man, that is easy to see, \
and I am\\nonly a simple man. But it seems to me--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I suppose,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] interrupted the \
other contemptuously, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that you believe\\nLenin is a \
real friend of the proletariat?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, I do,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the \
soldier, suffering.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, my friend, do you know \
that Lenin was sent through Germany in\\na closed car? Do you know that Lenin \
took money from the Germans?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know much about that,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the soldier\\nstubbornly, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]but it seems to me that what he says is what I want to\
\\nhear, and all the simple men like me. Now there are two classes, \
the\\nbourgeoisie and the proletariat--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are a fool! Why, my friend, I spent two years in \
Schl\[UDoubleDot]sselburg\\nfor revolutionary activity, when you were still \
shooting down\\nrevolutionists and singing \[OpenCurlyQuote]God Save the \
Tsar!\[CloseCurlyQuote] My name is Vasili\\nGeorgevitch Panyin. Didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you ever hear of me?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m sorry to say I never did,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered the soldier with humility.\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But then, I am not an educated man. You are probably a \
great hero.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the student with conviction. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And I am opposed to the\\nBolsheviki, who are \
destroying our Russia, our free Revolution. Now\\nhow do you account for \
that?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe soldier scratched his head. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t account for it at all,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nsaid, grimacing with the pain of his \
intellectual processes. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To me\\nit seems perfectly \
simple--but then, I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m not well educated. It seems\\nlike \
there are only two classes, the proletariat and the\\nbourgeoisie--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There you go again with \
your silly formula!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried the student.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]--only two classes,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] went on \
the soldier, doggedly.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And whoever isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t on one side is on the other...\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\nWe wandered on up the street, where the lights were few and far\\nbetween, \
and where people rarely passed. A threatening silence hung\\nover the \
place--as of a sort of purgatory between heaven and hell, a\\npolitical No \
Man\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Land. Only the barber shops were all \
brilliantly\\nlighted and crowded, and a line formed at the doors of the \
public\\nbath; for it was Saturday night, when all Russia bathes and perfumes\
\\nitself. I haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the slightest doubt that Soviet troops \
and\\nCossacks mingled in the places where these ceremonies were \
performed.\\n\\nThe nearer we came to the Imperial Park, the more deserted \
were the\\nstreets. A frightened priest pointed out the headquarters of \
the\\nSoviet, and hurried on. It was in the wing of one of the Grand \
Ducal\\npalaces, fronting the Park. The windows were dark, the door \
locked.\\nA soldier, lounging about with his hands in the top of his \
trousers,\\nlooked us up and down with gloomy suspicion. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Soviet went away\\ntwo days ago,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A shrug. _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Nie znayu._ I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nknow.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA little further \
along was a large building, brightly illuminated.\\nFrom within came a sound \
of hammering. While we were hesitating, a\\nsoldier and a sailor came down \
the street, hand in hand. I showed\\nthem my pass from Smolny. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are you for the Soviets?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I \
asked. They\\ndid not answer, but looked at each other in a frightened \
way.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What is going on in there?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked the sailor, pointing to the\\nbuilding.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\\n\\nTimidly the soldier put out his hand and opened the door a \
crack.\\nInside a great hall hung with bunting and evergreens, rows \
of\\nchairs, a stage being built.\\n\\nA stout woman with a hammer in her \
hand and her mouth full of tacks\\ncame out. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What do \
you want?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she asked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Is \
there a performance to-night?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the sailor, \
nervously.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There will be private theatricals \
Sunday night,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] she answered\\nseverely. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Go away.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe tried to \
engage the soldier and sailor in conversation, but they\\nseemed frightened \
and unhappy, and drew off into the darkness.\\n\\nWe strolled toward the \
Imperial Palaces, along the edge of the vast,\\ndark gardens, their fantastic \
pavilions and ornamental bridges\\nlooming uncertainly in the night, and soft \
water splashing from the\\nfountains. At one place, where a ridiculous iron \
swan spat\\nunceasingly from an artificial grotto, we were suddenly aware \
of\\nobservation, and looked up to encounter the sullen, suspicious gaze\\nof \
half a dozen gigantic armed soldiers, who stared moodily down\\nfrom a grassy \
terrace. I climbed up to them. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are the \
guard,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered one. They all looked very depressed, \
as\\nundoubtedly they were, from weeks and weeks of all-day \
all-night\\nargument and debate.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Are you Kerensky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s troops, or the Soviets\[CloseCurlyQuote]?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThere was silence for a moment, as they looked \
uneasily at each\\nother. Then, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are neutral,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he.\\n\\nWe went on through the arch of the \
huge Ekaterina Palace, into the\\nPalace enclosure itself, asking for \
headquarters. A sentry outside a\\ndoor in a curving white wing of the Palace \
said that the commandant\\nwas inside.\\n\\nIn a graceful, white, Georgian \
room, divided into unequal parts by a\\ntwo-sided fire-place, a group of \
officers stood anxiously talking.\\nThey were pale and distracted, and \
evidently hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t slept. To one,\\nan oldish man with a white \
beard, his uniform studded with\\ndecorations, who was pointed out as the \
Colonel, we showed our\\nBolshevik papers.\\n\\nHe seemed surprised. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How did you get here without being killed?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nasked politely. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is \
very dangerous in the streets just now.\\nPolitical passion is running very \
high in Tsarskoye Selo. There was\\na battle this morning, and there will be \
another to-morrow morning.\\nKerensky is to enter the town at eight o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
Where are the \
Cossacks?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]About a mile \
over that way.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He waved his arm.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And you will defend the city against them?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh dear no.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He smiled. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are holding the \
city for Kerensky.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Our\\nhearts sank, for our passes \
stated that we were revolutionary to the\\ncore. The Colonel cleared his \
throat. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]About those passes of yours,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nhe went on. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Your lives will \
be in danger if you are captured.\\nTherefore, if you want to see the battle, \
I will give you an order\\nfor rooms in the officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] hotel, \
and if you will come back here at\\nseven o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in the \
morning, I will give you new passes.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]So you are for Kerensky?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] we \
said.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, not exactly _for_ Kerensky.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The Colonel hesitated. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You \
see,\\nmost of the soldiers in the garrison are Bolsheviki, and \
to-day,\\nafter the battle, they all went away in the direction of Petrograd,\
\\ntaking the artillery with them. You might say that none of \
the\\n_soldiers_ are for Kerensky; but some of them just \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to\\nfight at all. The _officers_ have almost all \
gone over to Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nforces, or simply gone away. We \
are--ahem--in a most difficult\\nposition, as you see....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe did not believe that there would be any \
battle.... The Colonel\\ncourteously sent his orderly to escort us to the \
railroad station.\\nHe was from the South, born of French immigrant parents \
in\\nBessarabia. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he kept \
saying, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]it is not the danger or the\\nhardships I \
mind, but being so long, three years, away from my\\nmother....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nLooking out of the window of the train as we \
sped through the cold\\ndark toward Petrograd, I caught glimpses of clumps of \
soldiers\\ngesticulating in the light of fires, and of clusters of \
armoured\\ncars halted together at cross-roads, the chauffeurs hanging out of\
\\nthe turrets and shouting to each other....\\n\\nAll the troubled night \
over the bleakflats leaderless bands of\\nsoldiers and Red Guards wandered, \
clashing and confused, and the\\nCommissars of the Military Revolutionary \
Committee hurried from one\\ngroup to another, trying to organise a \
defence....\\n\\nBack in town excited throngs were moving in tides up and \
down the\\nNevsky. Something was in the air. From the Warsaw Railway \
station\\ncould be heard far-off cannonade. In the _yunker_ schools there was\
\\nfeverish activity. Duma members went from barracks to barracks,\\narguing \
and pleading, narrating fearful stories of Bolshevik\\nviolence--massacre of \
the _yunkers_ in the Winter Palace, rape of the\\nwomen soldiers, the \
shooting of the girl before the Duma, the murder\\nof Prince Tumanov.... In \
the Alexander Hall of the Duma building the\\nCommittee for Salvation was in \
special session; Commissars came and\\nwent, running.... All the journalists \
expelled from Smolny were there,\\nin high spirits. They did not believe our \
report of conditions in\\nTsarskoye. Why, everybody knew that Tsarskoye was \
in Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nhands, and that the Cossacks were now at \
Pulkovo. A committee was\\nbeing elected to meet Kerensky at the railway \
station in the\\nmorning....\\n\\nOne confided to me, in strictest secrecy, \
that the\\ncounter-revolution would begin at midnight. He showed me \
two\\nproclamations, one signed by Gotz and Polkovnikov, ordering \
the\\n_yunker_ schools, soldier convalescents in the hospitals, and \
the\\nKnights of St. George to mobilise on a war footing and wait \
for\\norders from the Committee for Salvation; the other from the\\nCommittee \
for Salvation itself, which read as follows:\\n\\nTo the Population of \
Petrograd!\\n\\nComrades, workers, soldiers and citizens of revolutionary \
Petrograd!\\n\\nThe Bolsheviki, while appealing for peace at the front, are \
inciting\\nto civil war in the rear.\\n\\nDo not dig their provocatory \
appeals!\\n\\nDo not dig trenches!\\n\\nDown with the traitorous \
barricades!\\n\\nLay down your arms!\\n\\nSoldiers, return to your \
barracks!\\n\\nThe war begun in Petrograd--is the death of the Revolution!\\n\
\\nIn the name of liberty, land, and peace, unite around the Committee\\nfor \
Salvation of Country and Revolution!\\n\\nAs we left the Duma a company of \
Red Guards, stern-faced and\\ndesperate, came marching down the dark, \
deserted street with a dozen\\nprisoners--members of the local branch of the \
Council of Cossacks,\\ncaught red-handed plotting counter-revolution in their \
headquarters....\\n\\nA soldier, accompanied by a small boy with a pail of \
paste, was\\nsticking up great flaring notices:\\n\\nBy virtue of the \
present, the city of Petrograd and its suburbs are\\ndeclared in a state of \
siege. All assemblies or meetings in the\\nstreets, and generally in the open \
air, are forbidden until further\\norders.\\n\\nN. PODVOISKY, President of \
the Military\\n\\nRevolutionary Committee.\\n\\nAs we went home the air was \
full of confused sound--automobile horns,\\nshouts, distant shots. The city \
stirred uneasily, wakeful.\\n\\nIn the small hours of the morning a company \
of _yunkers,_ disguised\\nas soldiers of the Semionovsky Regiment, presented \
themselves at the\\nTelephone Exchange just before the hour of changing \
guard. They had\\nthe Bolshevik password, and took charge without arousing \
suspicion.\\nA few minutes later Antonov appeared, making a round of \
inspection.\\nHim they captured and locked in a small room. When the relief \
came\\nit was met by a blast of rifle-fire, several being \
killed.\\n\\nCounter-revolution had begun...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter \
VIII\\n\\nCounter-Revolution\\n\\n\\nNext morning, Sunday the 11th, the \
Cossacks entered Tsarskoye Selo,\\nKerensky (See App. VIII, Sect. 1) himself \
riding a white horse and\\nall the church-bells clamouring. From the top of a \
little hill\\noutside the town could be seen the golden spires and \
many-coloured\\ncupolas, the sprawling grey immensity of the capital spread \
along\\nthe dreary plain, and beyond, the steely Gulf of Finland.\\n\\nThere \
was no battle. But Kerensky made a fatal blunder. At seven in\\nthe morning \
he sent word to the Second Tsarskoye Selo Rifles to lay\\ndown their arms. \
The soldiers replied that they would remain\\nneutral, but would not disarm. \
Kerensky gave them ten minutes in\\nwhich to obey. This angered the soldiers; \
for eight months they had\\nbeen governing themselves by committee, and this \
smacked of the old\\nr\[EAcute]gime.... A few minutes later Cossack artillery \
opened fire on the\\nbarracks, killing eight men. From that moment there were \
no more\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]neutral\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] soldiers in \
Tsarskoye....\\n\\nPetrograd woke to bursts of rifle-fire, and the tramping \
thunder of\\nmen marching. Under the high dark sky a cold wind smelt of snow. \
At\\ndawn the Military Hotel and the Telegraph Agency had been taken \
by\\nlarge forces of _yunkers,_ and bloodily recaptured. The \
Telephone\\nStation was besieged by sailors, who lay behind barricades \
of\\nbarrels, boxes and tin sheets in the middle of the Morskaya, \
or\\nsheltered themselves at the corner of the Gorokhovaya and of St.\\nIsaac\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Square, shooting at anything that moved. Occasionally \
an\\nautomobile passed in and out, flying the Red Cross flag. The \
sailors\\nlet it pass....\\n\\nAlbert Rhys Williams was in the Telephone \
Exchange. He went out with\\nthe Red Cross automobile, which was ostensibly \
full of wounded.\\nAfter circulating about the city, the car went by devious \
ways\\nto the Mikhailovsky _yunker_ school, headquarters of \
the\\ncounter-revolution. A French officer, in the court-yard, seemed to\\nbe \
in command.... By this means ammunition and supplies were conveyed\\nto the \
Telephone Exchange. Scores of these pretended ambulances\\nacted as couriers \
and ammunition trains for the _yunkers._\\n\\nFive or six armoured cars, \
belonging to the disbanded British\\nArmoured Car Division, were in their \
hands. As Louise Bryant was\\ngoing along St. Isaac\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Square \
one came rolling up from the\\nAdmiralty, on its way to the Telephone \
Exchange. At the corner of\\nthe Gogolia, right in front of her, the engine \
stalled. Some sailors\\nambushed behind wood-piles began shooting. The \
machine-gun in the\\nturret of the thing slewed around and spat a hail of \
bullets\\nindiscriminately into the wood-piles and the crowd. In the \
archway\\nwhere Miss Bryant stood seven people were shot dead, among them two\
\\nlittle boys. Suddenly, with a shout, the sailors leaped up and\\nrushed \
into the flaming open; closing around the monster, they\\nthrust their \
bayonets into the loop-holes, again and again, yelling...\\nThe chauffeur \
pretended to be wounded, and they let him go free--to\\nrun to the Duma and \
swell the tale of Bolshevik atrocities....Among\\nthe dead was a British \
Officer....\\n\\nLater the newspapers told of another French officer, \
captured in a\\n_yunker_ armoured car and sent to Peter-Paul. The French \
Embassy\\npromptly denied this, but one of the City Councillors told me \
that\\nhe himself had procured the officer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s release from \
prison....\\n\\nWhatever the official attitude of the Allied Embassies, \
individual\\nFrench and British officers were active these days, even to \
the\\nextent of giving advice at executive sessions of the Committee \
for\\nSalvation.\\n\\nAll day long in every quarter of the city there were \
skirmishes\\nbetween _yunkers_ and Red Guards, battles between armoured \
cars....\\nVolleys, single shots and the shrill chatter of machine-guns could\
\\nbe heard, far and near. The iron shutters of the shops were drawn,\\nbut \
business still went on. Even the moving-picture shows, all\\noutside lights \
dark, played to crowded houses. The street-cars ran.\\nThe telephones were \
all working; when you called Central, shooting\\ncould be plainly heard over \
the wire.... Smolny was cut off, but the\\nDuma and the Committee for \
Salvation were in constant communication\\nwith all the _yunker_ schools and \
with Kerensky at Tsarskoye.\\n\\nAt seven in the morning the Vladimir \
_yunker_ school was visited by\\na patrol of soldiers, sailors and Red \
Guards, who gave the _yunkers_\\ntwenty minutes to lay down their arms. The \
ultimatum was rejected.\\nAn hour later the _yunkers_ got ready to march, but \
were driven back\\nby a violent fusillade from the corner of the Grebetskaya \
and the\\nBolshoy Prospekt. Soviet troops surrounded the building and \
opened\\nfire, two armoured cars cruising back and forth with machine \
guns\\nraking it. The _yunkers_ telephoned for help. The Cossacks \
replied\\nthat they dare not come, because a large body of sailors with \
two\\ncannon commanded their barracks. The Pavlovsk school was \
surrounded.\\nMost of the Mikhailov _yunkers_ were fighting in the \
streets....\\n\\nAt half-past eleven three field-pieces arrived. Another \
demand to\\nsurrender was met by the _yunkers_ shooting down two of the \
Soviet\\ndelegates under the white flag. Now began a real bombardment. \
Great\\nholes were torn in the walls of the school. The _yunkers_ \
defended\\nthemselves desperately; shouting waves of Red Guards, \
assaulting,\\ncrumpled under the withering blast.... Kerensky telephoned from\
\\nTsarskoye to refuse all parley with the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee.\\n\\nFrenzied by defeat and their heaps of dead, \
the Soviet troops opened\\na tornado of steel and flame against the battered \
building. Their\\nown officers could not stop the terrible bombardment. A \
Commissar\\nfrom Smolny named Kirilov tried to halt it; he was threatened \
with\\nlynching. The Red Guards\[CloseCurlyQuote] blood was up.\\n\\nAt \
half-past two the _yunkers_ hoisted a white flag; they would\\nsurrender if \
they were guaranteed protection. This was promised.\\nWith a rush and a shout \
thousands of soldiers and Red Guards poured\\nthrough windows, doors and \
holes in the wall. Before it could be\\nstopped five _yunkers_ were beaten \
and stabbed to death. The rest,\\nabout two hundred, were taken to Peter-Paul \
under escort, in small\\ngroups so as to avoid notice. On the way a mob set \
upon one party,\\nkilling eight more _yunkers_.... More than a hundred Red \
Guards and\\nsoldiers had fallen....\\n\\nTwo hours later the Duma got a \
telephone message that the victors\\nwere marching toward the _Injinierny \
Zamok_--the Engineers\[CloseCurlyQuote] school. A\\ndozen members immediately \
set out to distribute among them armfuls\\nof the latest proclamation of the \
Committee for Salvation. Several\\ndid not come back.... All the other \
schools surrendered without\\nresistance, and the _yunkers_ were sent \
unharmed to Peter-Paul and\\nCronstadt....\\n\\nThe Telephone Exchange held \
out until afternoon, when a Bolshevik\\narmoured car appeared, and the \
sailors stormed the place. Shrieking,\\nthe frightened telephone girls ran to \
and fro; the _yunkers_ tore\\nfrom their uniforms all distinguishing marks, \
and one offered\\nWilliams _anything_ for the loan of his overcoat, as a \
disguise....\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They will massacre us! They will \
massacre us!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they cried, for many\\nof them had given \
their word at the Winter Palace not to take up\\narms against the People. \
Williams offered to mediate if Antonov were\\nreleased. This was immediately \
done; Antonov and Williams made\\nspeeches to the victorious sailors, \
inflamed by their many dead--and\\nonce more the _yunkers_ went free.... All \
but a few, who in their\\npanic tried to flee over the roofs, or to hide in \
the attic, and\\nwere found and hurled into the street.\\n\\nTired, bloody, \
triumphant, the sailors and workers swarmed into the\\nswitchboard room, and \
finding so many pretty girls, fell back in an\\nembarrassed way and fumbled \
with awkward feet. Not a girl was\\ninjured, not one insulted. Frightened, \
they huddled in the corners,\\nand then, finding themselves safe, gave vent \
to their spite. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ugh!\\nThe dirty, ignorant people! The \
fools!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... The sailors and Red Guards\\nwere \
embarrassed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Brutes! Pigs!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
shrilled the girls, indignantly\\nputting on their coats and hats. Romantic \
had been their experience\\npassing up cartridges and dressing the wounds of \
their dashing young\\ndefenders, the _yunkers,_ many of them members of noble \
families,\\nfighting to restore their beloved Tsar! These were just \
common\\nworkmen, peasants, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Dark People.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]...\\n\\nThe Commissar of the Military Revolutionary \
Committee, little\\nVishniak, tried to persuade the girls to remain. He was \
effusively\\npolite. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You have been badly treated,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
telephone\\nsystem is controlled by the Municipal Duma. You are paid \
sixty\\nrubles a month, and have to work ten hours and more.... From now \
on\\nall that will be changed. The Government intends to put the\\ntelephones \
under control of the Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs.\\nYour wages will be \
immediately raised to one hundred and fifty\\nrubles, and your working-hours \
reduced. As members of the\\nworking-class you should be happy--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nMembers of the _working-class_ indeed! Did he \
mean to infer that\\nthere was anything in common between these--these \
animals--and _us?_\\nRemain? Not if they offered a thousand rubles!... \
Haughty and spiteful\\nthe girls left the place....\\n\\nThe employees of the \
building, the line-men and labourers--they\\nstayed. But the switch-boards \
must be operated--the telephone was\\nvital.... Only half a dozen trained \
operators were available.\\nVolunteers were called for; a hundred responded, \
sailors, soldiers,\\nworkers. The six girls scurried backward and forward, \
instructing,\\nhelping, scolding.... So, crippled, halting, but _going,_ the \
wires\\nslowly began to hum. The first thing was to connect Smolny with \
the\\nbarracks and the factories; the second, to cut off the Duma and \
the\\n_yunker_ schools.... Late in the afternoon word of it spread \
through\\nthe city, and hundreds of bourgeois called up to scream, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Fools!\\nDevils! How long do you think you will last? \
Wait till the Cossacks\\ncome!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDusk was already \
falling. On the almost deserted Nevsky, swept by a\\nbitter wind, a crowd had \
gathered before the Kazan Cathedral,\\ncontinuing the endless debate; a few \
workmen, some soldiers and the\\nrest shop-keepers, clerks and the \
like.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But Lenin won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t get \
Germany to make peace!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried one.\\n\\nA violent \
young soldier replied. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And whose fault is it? Your \
damn\\nKerensky, dirty bourgeois! To hell with Kerensky! We don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want him!\\nWe want \
Lenin....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOutside the Duma an officer with a \
white arm-band was tearing down\\nposters from the wall, swearing loudly. One \
read:\\n\\nTo the Population of Petrograd!\\n\\nAt this dangerous hour, when \
the Municipal Duma ought to use\\nevery means to calm the population, to \
assure it bread and\\nother necessities, the Right Socialist Revolutionaries \
and the\\nCadets, forgetting their duty, have turned the Duma into \
a\\ncounter-revolutionary meeting, trying to raise part of the\\npopulation \
against the rest, so as to facilitate the victory of\\nKornilov-Kerensky. \
Instead of doing their duty, the Right Socialist\\nRevolutionaries and the \
Cadets have transformed the Duma into an\\narena of political attack upon the \
Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, against the revolutionary Government \
of\\npeace, bread and liberty.\\n\\nCitizens of Petrograd, we, the Bolshevik \
Municipal Councillors\\nelected by you--we want you to know that the Right \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries and the Cadets are engaged in \
counter-revolutionary\\naction, have forgotten their duty, and are leading \
the population to\\nfamine, to civil war. We, elected by 183,000 votes, \
consider it our\\nduty to bring to the attention of our constituents what is \
going on\\nin the Duma, and declare that we disclaim all responsibility for \
the\\nterrible but inevitable consequences....\\n\\nFar away still sounded \
occasional shots, but the city lay quiet,\\ncold, as if exhausted by the \
violent spasms which had torn it.\\n\\nIn the Nicolai Hall the Duma session \
was coming to an end. Even the\\ntruculent Duma seemed a little stunned. One \
after another the\\nCommissars reported--capture of the Telephone \
Exchange,\\nstreet-fighting, the taking of the Vladimir school.... \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Duma,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nsaid Trupp, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is on the side of the democracy in its struggle \
against\\narbitrary violence; but in any case, whichever side wins, the \
Duma\\nwill always be against lynchings and torture....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nKonovski, Cadet, a tall old man with a cruel \
face: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When the troops\\nof the legal Government arrive \
in Petrograd, they will shoot down\\nthese insurgents, and that will not be \
lynching!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Protests all over\\nthe hall, even from his \
own party.\\n\\nHere there was doubt and depression. The counter-revolution \
was\\nbeing put down. The Central Committee of the Socialist \
Revolutionary\\nparty had voted lack of confidence in its officers; the left \
wing\\nwas in control; Avksentiev had resigned. A courier reported\\nthat the \
Committee of Welcome sent to meet Kerensky at the railway\\nstation had been \
arrested. In the streets could be heard the dull\\nrumble of distant \
cannonading, south and southwest. Still Kerensky\\ndid not come...\\n\\nOnly \
three newspapers were out--_Pravda, Dielo Naroda_ and _Novaya\\nZhizn._ All \
of them devoted much space to the new \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]coalition\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nGovernment. The Socialist Revolutionary paper \
demanded a Cabinet\\nwithout either Cadets or Bolsheviki. Gorky was hopeful; \
Smolny had\\nmade concessions. A purely Socialist Government was taking \
shape--all\\nelements except the bourgeoisie. As for _Pravda,_ it sneered:\\n\
\\nWe ridicule these coalitions with political parties whose most\\nprominent \
members are petty journalists of doubtful reputation; our\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]coalition\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is that of the \
proletariat and the revolutionary Army\\nwith the poor peasants...\\n\\nOn \
the walls a vainglorious announcement of the _Vikzhel,_\\nthreatening to \
strike if both sides did not compromise:\\n\\nThe conquerors of these riots, \
the saviours of the wreck of our\\ncountry, these will be neither the \
Bolsheviki, nor the Committee for\\nSalvation, nor the troops of \
Kerensky--but we, the Union of\\nRailwaymen...\\n\\nRed Guards are incapable \
of handling a complicated business like the\\nrailways; as for the \
Provisional Government, it has shown itself\\nincapable of holding the \
power...\\n\\nWe refuse to lend our services to any party which does not act \
by\\nauthority of ... a Government based on the confidence of all \
the\\ndemocracy....\\n\\nSmolny thrilled with the boundless vitality of \
inexhaustible\\nhumanity in action.\\n\\nIn Trade Union headquarters Lozovsky \
introduced me to a delegate of\\nthe Railway Workers of the Nicolai line, who \
said that the men were\\nholding huge mass-meetings, condemning the action of \
their leaders.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All power to the Soviets!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried, pounding on the table.\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The _oborontsi_ in the Central Committee are playing \
Kornilov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\ngame. They tried to send a mission to the \
Stavka, but we arrested\\nthem at Minsk.... Our branch has demanded an \
All-Russian\\nConvention, and they refuse to call it....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe same situation as in the Soviets, the Army \
Committees. One after\\nanother the various democratic organisations, all \
over Russia, were\\ncracking and changing. The Cooperatives were torn by \
internal\\nstruggles; the meetings of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Executive broke up in\\nstormy wrangling; even among the Cossacks there was \
trouble....\\n\\nOn the top floor the Military Revolutionary Committee was in \
full\\nblast, striking and slacking not. Men went in, fresh and \
vigorous;\\nnight and day and night and day they threw themselves into \
the\\nterrible machine; and came out limp, blind with fatigue, hoarse \
and\\nfilthy, to fall on the floor and sleep.... The Committee for \
Salvation\\nhad been outlawed. Great piles of new proclamations (See App. \
VIII,\\nSect. 2) littered the floor:\\n\\n... The conspirators, who have no \
support among the garrison or the\\nworking-class, above all counted on the \
suddenness of their attack.\\nTheir plan was discovered in time by \
Sub-Lieutenant Blagonravov,\\nthanks to the revolutionary vigilance of a \
soldier of the Red Guard,\\nwhose name shall be made public. At the centre of \
the plot was the\\nCommittee for Salvation. Colonel Polkovnikov was in \
command of their\\nforces, and the orders were signed by Gotz, former member \
of the\\nProvisional Government, allowed at liberty on his word of honour....\
\\n\\nBringing these facts to the attention of the Petrograd \
population,\\nthe Military Revolutionary Committee orders the arrest of \
all\\nconcerned in the conspiracy, who shall be tried before \
the\\nRevolutionary Tribunal....\\n\\nFrom Moscow, word that the _yunkers_ \
and Cossacks had surrounded the\\nKremlin and ordered the Soviet troops to \
lay down their arms. The\\nSoviet forces complied, and as they were leaving \
the Kremlin, were\\nset upon and shot down. Small forces of Bolsheviki had \
been driven\\nfrom the Telephone and Telegraph offices; the _yunkers_ now \
held the\\ncentre of the city. ... But all around them the Soviet troops were\
\\nmustering. Street-fighting was slowly gathering way; all attempts \
at\\ncompromise had failed.... On the side of the Soviet, ten \
thousand\\ngarrison soldiers and a few Red Guards; on the side of \
the\\nGovernment, six thousand _yunkers,_ twenty-five hundred Cossacks \
and\\ntwo thousand White Guards.\\n\\nThe Petrograd Soviet was meeting, and \
next door the new\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ acting on the decrees and orders (See App. \
VIII,\\nSect. 3) which came down in a steady stream from the Council \
of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars in session upstairs; on the Order \
in Which Laws\\nAre to be Ratified and Published, Establishing an Eight hour \
Days\\nfor Workers, and Lunatcharsky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Basis for a System of Popular\\nEducation.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Only a few hundred people were present at the \
two\\nmeetings, most of them armed. Smolny was almost deserted, except \
for\\nthe guards, who were busy at the hall windows, setting \
up\\nmachine-guns to command the flanks of the building.\\n\\nIn the \
_Tsay-ee-kah_ a delegate of the _Vikzhel_ was speaking: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We\\nrefuse to transport the troops of either \
party.... We have sent a\\ncommittee to Kerensky to say that if he continues \
to march on\\nPetrograd we will break his lines of communication....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe made the usual plea for a conference of all \
the Socialist parties\\nto form a new Government....\\n\\nKameniev answered \
discreetly. The Bolsheviki would be very glad to\\nattend the conference. The \
centre of gravity, however, lay not in\\ncomposition of such a Government, \
but in its acceptance of the\\nprogramme of the Congress of Soviets.\\n\\n... \
The _Tsay-ee-kah_ had deliberated on the declaration made by the\\nLeft \
Socialist Revolutionaries and the Social Democrats\\nInternationalists, and \
had accepted the proposition of proportional\\nrepresentation at the \
conference, even including delegates from the\\nArmy Committees and the \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets....\\n\\nIn the great hall, Trotzky \
recounted the events of the day.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We offered the \
Vladimir _yunkers_ a chance to surrender,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said.\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We wanted to settle matters without bloodshed. But now \
that blood\\nhas been spilled there is only one way--pitiless struggle. It \
would\\nbe childish to think we can win by any other means.... The moment \
is\\ndecisive. Everybody must cooperate with the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee, report where there are stores of barbed wire, \
benzine,\\nguns.... We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve won the power; now we must keep \
it!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Menshevik Yoffe tried to read his party\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s declaration, but\\nTrotzky refused to allow \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]a debate about \
principle.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our debates \
are now in the streets,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The decisive step\\nhas been taken. We all, and I in \
particular, take the responsibility\\nfor what is happening....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSoldiers from the front, from Gatchina, told \
their stories. One from\\nthe Death Battalion, Four Hundred Eighty-first \
Artillery: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When the\\ntrenches hear of this, they will \
cry, \[OpenCurlyQuote]This is _our_ Government!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A\\n_yunker_ from Peterhof said that he and two \
others had refused to\\nmarch against the Soviets; and when his comrades had \
returned from\\nthe defence of the Winter Palace they appointed him their \
Commissar,\\nto go to Smolny and offer their services to the _real_ \
Revolution....\\n\\nThen Trotzky again, fiery, indefatigable, giving orders, \
answering\\nquestions.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The petty bourgeoisie, in \
order to defeat the workers, soldiers and\\npeasants, would combine with the \
devil himself!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said once. Many\\ncases of \
drunkenness had been remarked the last two days. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No\\ndrinking, comrades! No one must be on the streets \
after eight in the\\nevening, except the regular guards. All places suspected \
of having\\nstores of liquor should be searched, and the liquor destroyed. \
(See\\nApp. VIII, Sect. 4) No mercy to the sellers of liquor....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Military Revolutionary Committee sent for \
the delegation from\\nthe Viborg section; then for the members from Putilov. \
They clumped\\nout hurriedly.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]For each \
revolutionist killed,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Trotzky, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we shall kill five\\ncounter-revolutionists!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDown-town again. The Duma brilliantly \
illuminated and great crowds\\npouring in. In the lower hall wailing and \
cries of grief; the throng\\nsurged back and forth before the bulletin board, \
where was posted a\\nlist of _yunkers_ killed in the day\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
fighting--or supposed to be\\nkilled, for most of the dead afterward turned \
up safe and sound.... Up\\nin the Alexander Hall the Committee for Salvation \
held forth. The\\ngold and red epaulettes of officers were conspicuous, the \
familiar\\nfaces of the Menshevik and Socialist Revolutionary \
intellectuals,\\nthe hard eyes and bulky magnificence of bankers and \
diplomats,\\nofficials of the old r\[EAcute]gime, and well-dressed \
women....\\n\\nThe telephone girls were testifying. Girl after girl came to \
the\\ntribune--over-dressed, fashion-aping little girls, with pinched \
faces\\nand leaky shoes. Girl after girl, flushing with pleasure at \
the\\napplause of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nice\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
people of Petrograd, of the officers, the\\nrich, the great names of \
politics--girl after girl, to narrate her\\nsufferings at the hands of the \
proletariat, and proclaim her loyalty\\nto all that was old, established and \
powerful....\\n\\nThe Duma was again in session in the Nicolai Hall. The \
Mayor said\\nhopefully that the Petrograd regiments were ashamed of \
their\\nactions; propaganda was making headway.\\n\\n[Graphic, page 205: \
Proclamation for \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wine pogroms\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]]\
\\n\\nRevolutionary law and order. A proclamation of the Finland \
Regiment,\\nin December, 1917, announcing desperate remedies for \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wine pogroms.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nFor \
translation see Appendix 5.\\n\\n... Emissaries came and went, reporting \
horrible deeds by the\\nBolsheviki, interceding to save the _yunkers,_ busily \
investigating....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolsheviki,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Trupp, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]will be conquered \
by moral force, and\\nnot by \
bayonets.....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nMeanwhile all was not well on the \
revolutionary front. The enemy had\\nbrought up armoured trains, mounted with \
cannon. The Soviet forces,\\nmostly raw Red Guards, were without officers and \
without a definite\\nplan. Only five thousand regular soldiers had joined \
them; the rest\\nof the garrison was either busy suppressing the _yunker_ \
revolt,\\nguarding the city, or undecided what to do. At ten in the \
evening\\nLenin addressed a meeting of delegates from the city regiments, who\
\\nvoted overwhelmingly to fight. A Committee of five soldiers was\\nelected \
to serve as General Staff, and in the small hours of the\\nmorning the \
regiments left their barracks in full battle array....\\nGoing home I saw \
them pass, swinging along with the regular tread of\\nveterans, bayonets in \
perfect alignment, through the deserted\\nstreets of the conquered \
city....\\n\\nAt the same time, in the headquarters of the _Vikzhel_ down on \
the\\nSadovaya, the conference of all the Socialist parties to form a \
new\\nGovernment was under way. Abramovitch, for the centre \
Mensheviki,\\nsaid that there should be neither conquerors nor \
conquered--that\\nbygones should be bygones. ...In this were agreed all the \
left wing\\nparties. Dan, speaking in the name of the right Mensheviki, \
proposed\\nto the Bolsheviki the following conditions for a truce: The \
Red\\nGuard to be disarmed, and the Petrograd garrison to be placed at \
the\\norders of the Duma; the troops of Kerensky not to fire a single \
shot\\nor arrest a single man; a Ministry of all the Socialist \
parties\\n_except the Bolsheviki._ For Smolny Riazanov and Kameniev \
declared\\nthat a coalition ministry of all parties was acceptable, \
but\\nprotested at Dan\[CloseCurlyQuote]s proposals. The Socialist \
Revolutionaries were\\ndivided; but the Executive Committee of the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Soviets and\\nthe Populist Socialists flatly refused to \
admit the Bolsheviki....\\nAfter bitter quarrelling a commission was elected \
to draw up a\\nworkable plan....\\n\\nAll that night the commission wrangled, \
and all the next day, and\\nthe next night. Once before, on the 9th of \
November, there had been\\na similar effort at conciliation, led by Martov \
and Gorky; but at\\nthe approach of Kerensky and the activity of the \
Committee for\\nSalvation, the right wing of the Mensheviki, Socialist \
Revolutionaries\\nand Populist Socialists suddenly withdrew. Now they were \
awed by\\nthe crushing of the _yunker_ rebellion...\\n\\nMonday the 12th was \
a day of suspense. The eyes of all Russia were\\nfixed on the grey plain \
beyond the gates of Petrograd, where all the\\navailable strength of the old \
order faced the unorganised power of\\nthe new, the unknown. In Moscow a \
truce had been declared; both\\nsides parleyed, awaiting the result in the \
capital. Now the\\ndelegates to the Congress of Soviets, hurrying on speeding \
trains to\\nthe farthest reaches of Asia, were coming to their homes, \
carrying\\nthe fiery cross. In wide-spreading ripples news of the \
miracle\\nspread over the face of the land, and in its wake towns, cities and\
\\nfar villages stirred and broke, Soviets and Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittees against Dumas, Zemstvos and Government \
Commissars--Red\\nGuards against White--street fighting and passionate \
speech.... The\\nresult waited on the word from Petrograd....\\n\\nSmolny was \
almost empty, but the Duma was thronged and noisy. The\\nold Mayor, in his \
dignified way, was protesting against the Appeal\\nof the Bolshevik \
Councillors.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Duma is not a centre of \
counter-revolution,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, warmly.\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Duma takes no part in the present struggle between \
the parties.\\nBut at a time when there is no legal power in the land, the \
only\\ncentre of order is the Municipal Self-Government. The \
peaceful\\npopulation recognises this fact; the foreign Embassies \
recognise\\nonly such documents as are signed by the Mayor of the town. The \
mind\\nof a European does not admit of any other situation, as \
the\\nMunicipal self-government is the only organ which is capable \
of\\nprotecting the interests of the citizens. The City is bound to \
show\\nhospitality, to all organisations which desire to profit by \
such\\nhospitality, and therefore the Duma cannot prevent the \
distribution\\nof any newspapers whatever within the Duma building. The \
sphere of\\nour work is increasing, and we must be given full liberty of \
action,\\nand our rights must be respected by both parties....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are perfectly neutral. When the Telephone Exchange \
was occupied\\nby the _yunkers_ Colonel Polkovnikov ordered the telephones to\
\\nSmolny disconnected, but I protested, and the telephones were \
kept\\ngoing....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt this there was ironic \
laughter from the Bolshevik benches, and\\nimprecations from the right.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And yet,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] went on Schreider, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]they look upon us as\\ncounter-revolutionaries and \
report us to the population. They\\ndeprive us of our means of transport by \
taking away our last\\nmotor-cars. It will not be our fault if there is \
famine in the town.\\nProtests are of no \
use....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nKobozev, Bolshevik member of the Town \
Board, was doubtful whether\\nthe Military Revolutionary Committee had \
requisitioned the Municipal\\nautomobiles. Even granting the fact, it was \
probably done by some\\nunauthorised individual, in the emergency.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Mayor,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he continued, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]tells us that we must not make political\\nmeetings \
out of the Duma. But every Menshevik and Socialist\\nRevolutionary here talks \
nothing but party propaganda, and at the\\ndoor they distribute their illegal \
newspapers, _Iskri_ (Sparks),\\n_Soldatski Golos_ and _Rabotchaya Gazeta,_ \
inciting to insurrection.\\nWhat if we Bolsheviki should also begin to \
distribute our papers\\nhere? But this shall not be, for we respect the Duma. \
We have not\\nattacked the Municipal Self-Government, and we shall not do so. \
But\\nyou have addressed an Appeal to the population, and we are \
entitled\\nalso to do so....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFollowed him \
Shingariov, Cadet, who said that there could be no\\ncommon language with \
those who were liable to be brought before the\\nAttorney General for \
indictment, and who must be tried on the charge\\nof treason.... He proposed \
again that all Bolshevik members should be\\nexpelled from the Duma. This was \
tabled, however, for there were no\\npersonal charges against the members, \
and they were active in the\\nMunicipal administration.\\n\\nThen two \
Mensheviki Internationalists, declaring that the Appeal of\\nthe Bolshevik \
Councillors was a direct incitement to massacre. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If\\neverything that is against the Bolsheviki is \
counter-revolutionary,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nsaid Pinkevitch, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]then I do not know the difference between\\nrevolution \
and anarchy.... The Bolsheviki are depending upon the\\npassions of the \
unbridled masses; we have nothing but moral force.\\nWe will protest against \
massacres and violence from both sides, as\\nour task is to find a peaceful \
issue.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The notice posted \
in the streets under the heading \[OpenCurlyQuote]To the\\nPillory,\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] which calls upon the people to destroy the Mensheviki \
and\\nSocialist Revolutionaries,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Nazariev, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is a crime which you,\\nBolsheviki, will not be able \
to wash away. Yesterday\[CloseCurlyQuote]s horrors are\\nbut a preface to \
what you are preparing by such a proclamation.... I\\nhave always tried to \
reconcile you with the other parties, but at\\npresent I feel for you nothing \
but contempt!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Bolshevik Councillors were on \
their feet, shouting angrily,\\nassailed by hoarse, hateful voices and waving \
arms....\\n\\nOutside the hall I ran into the City Engineer, the Menshevik \
Gomberg\\nand three or four reporters. They were all in high spirits.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]See!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The cowards are afraid of us. They don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t dare\\narrest the Duma! Their Military Revolutionary \
Committee doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t dare\\nto send a Commissar into this \
building. Why, on the corner of the\\nSadovaya to-day, I saw a Red Guard try \
to stop a boy selling\\n_Soldatski Golos_.... The boy just laughed at him, \
and a crowd of\\npeople wanted to lynch the bandit. It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
only a few hours more, now.\\nEven if Kerensky wouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t come \
they haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the men to run a\\nGovernment. Absurd! I \
understand they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re even fighting among\\nthemselves at \
Smolny!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA Socialist Revolutionary friend of mine \
drew me aside. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I know\\nwhere the Committee for \
Salvation is hiding,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do you want\\nto go and talk with them?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBy this time it was dusk. The city had again \
settled down to\\nnormal--shop-shutters up, lights shining, and on the \
streets great\\ncrowds of people slowly moving up and down and arguing....\\n\
\\nAt Number 86 Nevsky we went through a passage into a \
courtyard,\\nsurrounded by tall apartment buildings. At the door of apartment \
229\\nmy friend knocked in a peculiar way. There was a sound of \
scuffling;\\nan inside door slammed; then the front door opened a crack and a\
\\nwoman\[CloseCurlyQuote]s face appeared. After a minute\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
observation she led us in--a\\nplacid-looking, middle-aged lady who at once \
cried, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kyril, it\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all\\nright!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In the dining-room, where a samovar steamed on the \
table and\\nthere were plates full of bread and raw fish, a man in \
uniform\\nemerged from behind the window-curtains, and another, dressed like \
a\\nworkman, from a closet. They were delighted to meet an \
American\\nreporter. With a certain amount of gusto both said that they would\
\\ncertainly be shot if the Bolsheviki caught them. They would not give\\nme \
their names, but both were Socialist Revolutionaries....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]do you publish such lies in your newspapers?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWithout taking offence the officer replied, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, I know; but what\\ncan we do?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He shrugged. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You must admit \
that it is necessary for us\\nto create a certain frame of mind in the \
people....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe other man interrupted. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is merely an adventure on the part\\nof the \
Bolsheviki. They have no intellectuals.... The Ministries\\nwon\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t work.... Russia is not a city, but a whole country.... \
Realising\\nthat they can only last a few days, we have decided to come to \
the\\naid of the strongest force opposed to them--Kerensky--and help \
to\\nrestore order.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That \
is all very well,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But \
why do you combine with the\\nCadets?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
pseudo-workman smiled frankly. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To tell you the truth, \
at this\\nmoment the masses of the people are following the Bolsheviki. \
We\\nhave no following--now. We can\[CloseCurlyQuote]t mobilise a handful of \
soldiers.\\nThere are no arms available.... The Bolsheviki are right to a \
certain\\nextent; there are at this moment in Russia only two parties with \
any\\nforce--the Bolsheviki and the reactionaries, who are all hiding \
under\\nthe coat-tails of the Cadets. The Cadets think they are using \
us;\\nbut it is really we who are using the Cadets. When we smash \
the\\nBolsheviki we shall turn against the Cadets....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Will the Bolsheviki be admitted into the new \
Government?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe scratched his head. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That\[CloseCurlyQuote]s a problem,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he admitted. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course\\nif \
they are not admitted, they\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll probably do this all over \
again.\\nAt any rate, they will have a chance to hold the balance of power in\
\\nthe Constituent--that is, if there _is_ a Constituent.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And then, too,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the officer, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that brings \
up the question of\\nadmitting the Cadets into the new Government--and for \
the same\\nreasons. You know the Cadets do not really want the \
Constituent\\nAssembly--not if the Bolsheviki can be destroyed now.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He shook his\\nhead. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is \
not easy for us Russians, politics. You Americans are\\nborn politicians; you \
have had politics all your lives. But for\\nus--well, it has only been a \
year, you know!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What do \
you think of Kerensky?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, Kerensky is guilty of the sins of the Provisional \
Government,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nanswered the other man. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kerensky himself forced us to accept\\ncoalition with \
the bourgeoisie. If he had resigned, as he\\nthreatened, it would have meant \
a new Cabinet crisis only sixteen\\nweeks before the Constituent Assembly, \
and that we wanted to avoid.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t it amount to that anyway?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, but how were we to \
know? They tricked us--the Kerenskys and\\nAvksentievs. Gotz is a little more \
radical. I stand with Tchernov,\\nwho is a real revolutionist.... Why, only \
to-day Lenin sent word that\\nhe would not object to Tchernov entering the \
Government.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We wanted to get rid of the Kerensky \
Government too, but we thought\\nit better to wait for the Constituent.... At \
the beginning of this\\naffair I was with the Bolsheviki, but the Central \
Committee of my\\nparty voted unanimously against it--and what could I do? It \
was a\\nmatter of party discipline....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In a week \
the Bolshevik Government will go to pieces; if the\\nSocialist \
Revolutionaries could only stand aside and wait, the\\nGovernment would fall \
into their hands. But if we wait a week the\\ncountry will be so disorganised \
that the German imperialists will be\\nvictorious. That is why we began our \
revolt with only two regiments\\nof soldiers promising to support us--and \
they turned against us....\\nThat left only the _yunkers_....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How about the Cossacks?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe officer sighed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They \
did not move. At first they said they\\nwould come out if they had infantry \
support. They said moreover that\\nthey had their men with Kerensky, and that \
they were doing their\\npart.... Then, too, they said that the Cossacks were \
always accused of\\nbeing the hereditary enemies of democracy.... And \
finally, \[OpenCurlyQuote]The\\nBolsheviki promise that they will not take \
away our land. There is\\nno danger to us. We remain neutral.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDuring this talk people were \
constantly entering and leaving--most of\\nthem officers, their \
shoulder-straps torn off. We could see them in\\nthe hall, and hear their \
low, vehement voices. Occasionally, through\\nthe half-drawn \
porti\[EGrave]res, we caught a glimpse of a door opening into\\na bath-room, \
where a heavily-built officer in a colonel\[CloseCurlyQuote]s uniform\\nsat \
on the toilet, writing something on a pad held in his lap. I\\nrecognised \
Colonel Polkovnikov, former commandant of Petrograd, for\\nwhose arrest the \
Military Revolutionary Committee would have paid a\\nfortune.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our programme?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the \
officer. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is it. Land to be turned\\nover to the \
Land Committees. Workmen to have full representation in\\nthe control of \
industry. An energetic peace programme, but not an\\nultimatum to the world \
such as the Bolsheviki issued. The Bolsheviki\\ncannot keep their promises to \
the masses, even in the country\\nitself. We won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t let \
them.... They stole our land programme in order\\nto get the support of the \
peasants. That is dishonest. If they had\\nwaited for the Constituent \
Assembly--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It doesn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t matter about the Constituent Assembly!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] broke in the\\nofficer. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If \
the Bolsheviki want to establish a Socialist state\\nhere, we cannot work \
with them in any event! Kerensky made the great\\nmistake. He let the \
Bolsheviki know what he was going to do by\\nannouncing in the Council of the \
Republic that he had ordered \
their\\narrest....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But what,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]do you intend to do \
now?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe two men looked at one another. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You will see in a few days. If\\nthere are enough \
troops from the front on our side, we shall not\\ncompromise with the \
Bolsheviki. If not, perhaps we shall be forced\\nto....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOut again on the Nevsky we swung on the step of \
a streetcar bulging\\nwith people, its platforms bent down from the weight \
and scraping\\nalong the ground, which crawled with agonising slowness the \
long\\nmiles to Smolny.\\n\\nMeshkovsky, a neat, frail little man, was coming \
down the hall,\\nlooking worried. The strikes in the Ministries, he told us, \
were\\nhaving their effect. For instance, the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars had promised to publish the Secret Treaties; \
but Neratov,\\nthe functionary in charge, had disappeared, taking the \
documents\\nwith him. They were supposed to be hidden in the British \
Embassy....\\n\\nWorst of all, however, was the strike in the banks. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Without money,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nsaid \
Menzhinsky, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we are helpless. The wages of the railroad \
men, of\\nthe postal and telegraph employees, must be paid.... The banks \
are\\nclosed; and the key to the situation, the State Bank, is also \
shut.\\nAll the bank-clerks in Russia have been bribed to stop work....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But Lenin has issued an order to dynamite the State \
Bank vaults,\\nand there is a Decree just out, ordering the private banks to \
open\\nto-morrow, or we will open them \
ourselves!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Petrograd Soviet was in full \
swing, thronged with armed men,\\nTrotzky reporting:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Cossacks are falling back from Krasnoye Selo.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Sharp, exultant\\ncheering.) \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But the battle is only beginning. At Pulkovo \
heavy\\nfighting is going on. All available forces must be hurried \
there....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]From Moscow, bad news. The Kremlin is \
in the hands of the\\n_yunkers,_ and the workers have only a few arms. The \
result depends\\nupon Petrograd.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At the front, \
the decrees on Peace and Land are provoking great\\nenthusiasm. Kerensky is \
flooding the trenches with tales of\\nPetrograd burning and bloody, of women \
and children massacred by the\\nBolsheviki. But no one believes him....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The cruisers _Oleg, Avrora_ and _Respublica_ are \
anchored in the\\nNeva, their guns trained on the approaches to the city....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why aren\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t you out there with the Red \
Guards?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shouted a rough\\nvoice.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]m going \
now!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered Trotzky, and left the platform. His \
face a\\nlittle paler than usual, he passed down the side of the \
room,\\nsurrounded by eager friends, and hurried out to the \
waiting\\nautomobile.\\n\\nKameniev now spoke, describing the proceedings of \
the reconciliation\\nconference. The armistice conditions proposed by the \
Mensheviki, he\\nsaid, had been contemptuously rejected. Even the branches of \
the\\nRailwaymen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Union had voted against such a \
proposition....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve \
won the power and are sweeping all Russia,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he\\ndeclared, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all they ask of us are three little \
things: 1. To\\nsurrender the power. 2. To make the soldiers continue the \
war. 3. To\\nmake the peasants forget about the land....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nLenin appeared for a moment, to answer the \
accusations of the\\nSocialist \
Revolutionaries:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They charge us with stealing \
their land programme.... If that is so,\\nwe bow to them. It is good enough \
for us....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSo the meeting roared on, leader \
after leader explaining, exhorting,\\narguing, soldier after soldier, workman \
after workman, standing up\\nto speak his mind and his heart.... The audience \
flowed, changing and\\nrenewed continually. From time to time men came in, \
yelling for the\\nmembers of such and such a detachment, to go to the front; \
others,\\nrelieved, wounded, or coming to Smolny for arms and \
equipment,\\npoured in....\\n\\nIt was almost three o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock \
in the morning when, as we left the\\nhall, Holtzman, of the Military \
Revolutionary Committee, came\\nrunning down the hall with a transfigured \
face.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all right!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he shouted, grabbing my hands. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Telegram from the\\nfront. Kerensky is smashed! Look \
at this!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe held out a sheet of paper, scribbled \
hurriedly in pencil, and\\nthen, seeing we couldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t read it, \
he declaimed aloud:\\n\\nPulkovo. Staff. 2.10 A.M.\\n\\nThe night of October \
30th to 31st will go down in history. The\\nattempt of Kerensky to move \
counter-revolutionary troops against the\\ncapital of the Revolution has been \
decisively repulsed. Kerensky is\\nretreating, we are advancing. The \
soldiers, sailors and workers of\\nPetrograd have shown that they can and \
will with arms in their hands\\nenforce the will and authority of the \
democracy. The bourgeoisie\\ntried to isolate the revolutionary army. \
Kerensky attempted to break\\nit by the force of the Cossacks. Both plans met \
a pitiful defeat.\\n\\nThe grand idea of the domination of the worker and \
peasant democracy\\nclosed the ranks of the army and hardened its will. All \
the country\\nfrom now on will be convinced that the Power of the Soviets is \
no\\nephemeral thing, but an invincible fact.... The repulse of Kerensky \
is\\nthe repulse of the land-owners, the bourgeoisie and the \
Kornilovists\\nin general. The repulse of Kerensky is the confirmation of the \
right\\nof the people to a peaceful free life, to land, bread and power. \
The\\nPulkovo detachment by its valorous blow has strengthened the cause\\nof \
the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Revolution. \
There is no return to the\\npast. Before us are struggles, obstacles and \
sacrifices. But the\\nroad is clear and victory is \
certain.\\n\\nRevolutionary Russia and the Soviet Power can be proud of their\
\\nPulkovo detachment, acting under the command of Colonel Walden.\\nEternal \
memory to those who fell! Glory to the warriors of the\\nRevolution, the \
soldiers and the officers who were faithful to the\\nPeople!\\n\\nLong live \
revolutionary, popular, Socialist Russia!\\n\\nIn the name of the Council,\\n\
\\nL. TROTZKY, People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar....\\n\\nDriving home \
across Znamensky Square, we made out an unusual crowd\\nin front of the \
Nicolai Railway Station. Several thousand sailors\\nwere massed there, \
bristling with rifles.\\n\\nStanding on the steps, a member of the _Vikzhel_ \
was pleading with\\nthem.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades, we cannot \
carry you to Moscow. We are neutral. We do not\\ncarry troops for either \
side. We cannot take you to Moscow, where\\nalready there is terrible civil \
war....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAll the seething Square roared at him; \
the sailors began to surge\\nforward. Suddenly another door was flung wide; \
in it stood two or\\nthree brakeman, a fireman or so.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This way, comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried one. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will take you to Moscow--or\\nVladivostok, if you \
like! Long live the Revolution!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter \
IX\\n\\nVictory\\n\\n\\n_Order Number I_\\n\\nTo the Troops of the Pulkovo \
Detachment.\\n\\nNovember 13, 1917. 38 minutes past 9 a. m.\\n\\nAfter a \
cruel fight the troops of the Pulkovo detachment completely\\nrouted the \
counter-revolutionary forces, who retreated from their\\npositions in \
disorder, and under cover of Tsarskoye Selo fell back\\ntoward Pavlovsk II \
and Gatchina.\\n\\nOur advanced units occupied the northeastern extremity of \
Tsarskoye\\nSelo and the station Alexandrovskaya. The Colpinno detachment was \
on\\nour left, the Krasnoye Selo detachment to our right.\\n\\nI ordered the \
Pulkovo forces to occupy Tsarskoye Selo, to fortify\\nits approaches, \
especially on the side of Gatchina.\\n\\nAlso to pass and occupy Pavlovskoye, \
fortifying its southern side,\\nand to take up the railroad as far as Dno.\\n\
\\nThe troops must take all measures to strengthen the positions\\noccupied \
by them, arranging trenches and other defensive works.\\n\\nThey must enter \
into close liaison with the detachments of Colpinno\\nand Krasnoye Selo, and \
also with the Staff of the Commander in Chief\\nfor the Defence of Petrograd.\

MURAVIOV.\\n\\nTuesday morning. But how is this? Only two days ago the \
Petrograd\\ncampagna was full of leaderless bands, wandering aimlessly; \
without\\nfood, without artillery, without a plan. What had fused \
that\\ndisorganised mass of undisciplined Red Guards, and soldiers \
without\\nofficers, into an army obedient to its own elected high \
command,\\ntempered to meet and break the assault of cannon and \
Cossack\\ncavalry? (See App. IX, Sect. 1)\\n\\nPeople in revolt have a way of \
defying military precedent. The\\nragged armies of the French Revolution are \
not forgotten--Valmy and\\nthe Lines of Weissembourg. Massed against the \
Soviet forces were\\n_yunkers,_ Cossacks, land-owners, nobility, Black \
Hundreds--the Tsar\\ncome again, _Okhrana_ and Siberian chains; and the vast \
and terrible\\nmenace of the Germans.... Victory, in the words of Carlyle, \
meant\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Apotheosis and Millennium without end!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSunday night, the Commissars of the Military \
Revolutionary Committee\\nreturning desperately from the field, the garrison \
of Petrograd\\nelected its Committee of Five, its Battle Staff, three \
soldiers and\\ntwo officers, all certified free from counter-revolutionary \
taint.\\nColonel Muraviov, ex-patriot, was in command--an efficient man, \
but\\nto be carefully watched. At Colpinno, at Obukhovo, at Pulkovo \
and\\nKrasnoye Selo were formed provisional detachments, increased in \
size\\nas the stragglers came in from the surrounding \
country--mixed\\nsoldiers, sailors and Red Guards, parts of regiments, \
infantry,\\ncavalry and artillery all together, and a few armoured \
cars.\\n\\nDay broke, and the pickets of Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Cossacks \
came in touch.\\nScattered rifle-fire, summons to surrender. Over the bleak \
plain on\\nthe cold quiet air spread the sound of battle, falling upon the \
ears\\nof roving bands as they gathered about their little fires, waiting....\
\\nSo it was beginning! They made toward the battle; and the worker\\nhordes \
pouring out along the straight roads quickened their pace....\\nThus upon all \
the points of attack automatically converged angry\\nhuman swarms, to be met \
by Commissars and assigned positions, or\\nwork to do. This was _their_ \
battle, for _their_ world; the officers\\nin command were elected by _them._ \
For the moment that incoherent\\nmultiple will was one will....\\n\\nThose \
who participated in the fighting described to me how the\\nsailors fought \
until they ran out of cartridges, and then stormed;\\nhow the untrained \
workmen rushed the charging Cossacks and tore them\\nfrom their horses; how \
the anonymous hordes of the people, gathering\\nin the darkness around the \
battle, rose like a tide and poured over\\nthe enemy.... Before midnight of \
Monday the Cossacks broke and were\\nfleeing, leaving their artillery behind \
them, and the army of the\\nproletariat, on a long ragged front, moved \
forward and rolled into\\nTsarskoye, before the enemy had a chance to destroy \
the great\\nGovernment wireless station, from which now the Commissars of \
Smolny\\nwere hurling out to the world paeans of triumph....\\n\\nTO ALL \

DEPUTIES\\n\\nThe 12th of November, in a bloody combat near Tsarskoye Selo, \
the\\nrevolutionary army defeated the counter-revolutionary troops \
of\\nKerensky and Kornilov. In the name of the Revolutionary Government \
I\\norder all regiments to take the offensive against the enemies of \
the\\nrevolutionary democracy, and to take all measures to arrest\\nKerensky, \
and also to oppose any adventure which might menace the\\nconquests of the \
Revolution and the victory of the proletariat.\\n\\nLong live the \
Revolutionary Army!\\nMURAVIOV.\\n\\nNews from the provinces....\\n\\nAt \
Sevastopol the local Soviet had assumed the power; a huge meeting\\nof the \
sailors on the battleships in the harbour had forced their\\nofficers to line \
up and swear allegiance to the new Government. At\\nNizhni Novgorod the \
Soviet was in control. From Kazan came reports\\nof a battle in the streets, \
_yunkers_ and a brigade of artillery\\nagainst the Bolshevik \
garrison....\\n\\nDesperate fighting had broken out again in Moscow. The \
_yunkers_ and\\nWhite Guards held the Kremlin and the centre of the town, \
beaten\\nupon from all sides by the troops of the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee. The Soviet artillery was stationed in Skobeliev \
Square,\\nbombarding the City Duma building, the Prefecture and the \
Hotel\\nMetropole. The cobblestones of the Tverskaya and Nikitskaya had \
been\\ntorn up for trenches and barricades. A hail of machine-gun \
fire\\nswept the quarters of the great banks and commercial houses. \
There\\nwere no lights, no telephones; the bourgeois population lived in \
the\\ncellars.... The last bulletin said that the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee had delivered an ultimatum to the Committee of \
Public\\nSafety, demanding the immediate surrender of the Kremlin, \
or\\nbombardment would follow.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bombard the \
Kremlin?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried the ordinary citizen. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They dare not!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFrom \
Vologda to Chita in far Siberia, from Pskov to Sevastopol on\\nthe Black Sea, \
in great cities and little villages, civil war burst\\ninto flame. From \
thousands of factories, peasant communes, regiments\\nand armies, ships on \
the wide sea, greetings poured into\\nPetrograd--greetings to the Government \
of the People.\\n\\nThe Cossack Government at Novotcherkask telegraphed to \
Kerensky,\\n_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government of the Cossack troops \
invites the Provisional\\nGovernment and the members of the Council of the \
Republic to come,\\nif possible, to Novotcherkask, where we can organise in \
common the\\nstruggle against the \
Bolsheviki.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n\\nIn Finland, also, things were \
stirring. The Soviet of Helsingfors\\nand the _Tsentrobalt_ (Central \
Committee of the Baltic Fleet),\\njointly proclaimed a state of siege, and \
declared that all attempts\\nto interfere with the Bolshevik forces, and all \
armed resistance to\\nits orders, would be severely repressed. At the same \
time the\\nFinnish Railway Union called a countrywide general strike, to \
put\\ninto operation the laws passed by the Socialist Diet of June, \
1917,\\ndissolved by Kerensky....\\n\\nEarly in the morning I went out to \
Smolny. Going up the long wooden\\nsidewalk from the outer gate I saw the \
first thin, hesitating\\nsnow-flakes fluttering down from the grey, windless \
sky. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Snow!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\ncried the soldier \
at the door, grinning with delight. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Good for \
the\\nhealth!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Inside, the long, gloomy halls and \
bleak rooms seemed\\ndeserted. No one moved in all the enormous pile. A deep, \
uneasy\\nsound came to my ears, and looking around, I noticed that everywhere\
\\non the floor, along the walls, men were sleeping. Rough, dirty \
men,\\nworkers and soldiers, spattered and caked with mud, sprawled \
alone\\nor in heaps, in the careless attitudes of death. Some wore \
ragged\\nbandages marked with blood. Guns and cartridge-belts were \
scattered\\nabout.... The victorious proletarian army!\\n\\nIn the upstairs \
buffet so thick they lay that one could hardly walk.\\nThe air was foul. \
Through the clouded windows a pale light streamed.\\nA battered samovar, \
cold, stood on the counter, and many glasses\\nholding dregs of tea. Beside \
them lay a copy of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
last bulletin, upside down, scrawled with\\npainful hand-writing. It was a \
memorial written by some soldier to\\nhis comrades fallen in the fight \
against Kerensky, just as he had\\nset it down before falling on the floor to \
sleep. The writing was\\nblurred with what looked like tears....\\n\\nAlexei \
Vinogradov\\n\\nD. Maskvin\\n\\nS. Stolbikov\\n\\nA. Voskressensky\\n\\nD. \
Leonsky\\n\\nD. Preobrazhensky\\n\\nV. Laidansky\\n\\nM. Berchikov\\n\\nThese \
men were drafted into the Army on November 15th, 1916. Only\\nthree are left \
of the above.\\n\\nMikhail Berchikov\\n\\nAlexei Voskressensky\\n\\nDmitri \

earth of the grave_\\n\\n_You have straitly closed your ranks. Sleep, \
Citizens!_\\n\\nOnly the Military Revolutionary Committee still \
functioned,\\nunsleeping. Skripnik, emerging from the inner room, said that \
Gotz\\nhad been arrested, but had flatly denied signing the proclamation \
of\\nthe Committee for Salvation, as had Avksentiev; and the Committee\\nfor \
Salvation itself had repudiated the Appeal to the garrison.\\nThere was still \
disafiection among the city regiments, Skripnik\\nreported; the Volhynsky \
Regiment had refused to fight against\\nKerensky.\\n\\nSeveral detachments of \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]neutral\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] troops, with Tchernov \
at their\\nhead, were at Gatchina, trying to persuade Kerensky to halt \
his\\nattack on Petrograd.\\n\\nSkripnik laughed. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There can be no \[OpenCurlyQuote]neutrals\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] now,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve\\nwon!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
His sharp, bearded face glowed with an almost religious\\nexaltation. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]More than sixty delegates have arrived from the Front,\
\\nwith assurances of support by all the armies except the troops on\\nthe \
Rumanian front, who have not been heard from. The Army\\nCommittees have \
suppressed all news from Petrograd, but we now have\\na regular system of \

        For the Commander in Chief, ANTONOV\\n                      Chief of \
Staff, VLAD. BONCH-BRUEVITCH\\n\\nDown in the front hall Kameniev was just \
entering, worn out by the\\nall-night session of the Conference to Form a New \
Government, but\\nhappy. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Already the Socialist \
Revolutionaries are inclined to admit\\nus into the new Government,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he told me. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The right wing \
groups are\\nfrightened by the Revolutionary Tribunals; they demand, in a \
sort of\\npanic, that we dissolve them before going any further. ... We \
have\\naccepted the proposition of the _Vikzhel_ to form a \
homogeneous\\nSocialist Ministry, and they\[CloseCurlyQuote]re working on \
that now. You see, it all\\nsprings from our victory. When we were down, they \
would\[CloseCurlyQuote]t have us at\\nany price; not everybody\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s in favour of some agreement with the\\nSoivets.... What \
we need is a really decisive victory. Kerensky wants\\nan armistice, but he\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll have to surrender (See App. IX, Sect. 2) ....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThat was the temper of the Bolshevik leaders. \
To a foreign\\njournalist who asked Trotzky what statement he had to make to \
the\\nworld, Trotzky replied: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At this moment the only \
statement possible\\nis the one we are making through the mouths of our \
cannon!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBut there was an undercurrent of real \
anxiety in the tide of\\nvictory; the question of finances. Instead of \
opening the banks, as\\nhad been ordered by the Military Revolutionary \
Committee, the Union\\nof Bank Employees had held a meeting and declared a \
formal strike.\\nSmolny had demanded some thirty-five millions of rubles from \
the\\nState Bank, and the cashier had locked the vaults, only paying \
out\\nmoney to the representatives of the Provisional Government. \
The\\nreactionaries were using the State Bank as a political weapon; \
for\\ninstance, when the _Vikzhel_ demanded money to pay the salaries \
of\\nthe employees of the Government railroads, it was told to apply \
to\\nSmolny....\\n\\nI went to the State Bank to see the new Commissar, a \
redhaired\\nUkrainean Bolshevik named Petrovitch. He was trying to bring \
order\\nout of the chaos in which affairs had been left by the \
striking\\nclerks. In all the offices of the huge place perspiring \
volunteer\\nworkers, soldiers and sailors, their tongues sticking out of \
their\\nmouths in the intensity of their effort, were poring over the \
great\\nledgers with a bewildered air....\\n\\nThe Duma building was crowded. \
There were still isolated cases of\\ndefiance toward the new Government, but \
they were rare. The Central\\nLand Committee had appealed to the Peasants, \
ordering them not to\\nrecognise the Land Decree passed by the Congress of \
the Soviets,\\nbecause it would cause confusion and civil war. Mayor \
Schreider\\nannounced that because of the Bolshevik insurrection, the \
elections\\nto the Constituent Assembly would have to be indefinitely \
postponed.\\n\\nTwo questions seemed to be uppermost in all minds, shocked by \
the\\nferocity of the civil war; first, a truce to the bloodshed (See \
App.\\nIX, Sect. 3)--second, the creation of a new Government. There was \
no\\nlonger any talk of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]destroying the Bolsheviki\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--and very little about\\nexcluding them from the \
Government, except from the Populist\\nSocialists and the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets. Even the Central Army\\nCommittee at the \
_Stavka,_ the most determined enemy of Smolny,\\ntelephoned from Moghilev: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If, to constitute the new Ministry, it is\\nnecessary \
to come to an understanding with the Bolsheviki, we agree\\nto admit them _in \
a minority_ to the Cabinet.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n_Pravda,_ ironically \
calling attention to Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]humanitarian\\nsentiments,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
published his despatch to the Committee for Salvation:\\n\\nIn accord with \
the proposals of the Committee for Salvation and all\\nthe democratic \
organisations united around it, I have halted all\\nmilitary action against \
the rebels. A delegate of the Committee has\\nbeen sent to enter into \
negotiations. Take all measures to stop the\\nuseless shedding of \
blood.\\n\\nThe _Vikzhel_ sent a telegram to all Russia:\\n\\nThe Conference \
of the Union of Railway Workers with the\\nrepresentatives of both the \
belligerent parties, who admit the\\nnecessity of an agreement, protest \
energetically against the use of\\npolitical terrorism in the civil war, \
especially when it is carried\\non between different factions of the \
revolutionary democracy, and\\ndeclare that political terrorism, in whatever \
form, is in\\ncontradiction to the very idea of the negotiations for a \
new\\nGovernment....\\n\\n[Graphic, page 227: Leaflet]\\n\\nPopular leaflet \
sold in the streets just after the Bolshevik\\ninsurrection, containing \
rhymes and jokes about the defeated\\nbourgeoisie and the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist leaders, \
Called, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How THE\\nBOORZHUI (BOURGEOISIE) LOST THE \
POWER.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDelegations from the Conference were sent \
to the Front, to Gatchina.\\nIn the Conference itself everything seemed on \
the point of final\\nsettlement. It had even been decided to elect a \
Provisional People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCouncil, composed of about four \
hundred members--seventy-five\\nrepresenting Smolny, seventy-five the old \
_Tsay-ee-kah,_ and the\\nrest split up among the Town Dumas, the Trade \
Unions, Land\\nCommittees and political parties. Tchernov was mentioned as \
the new\\nPremier. Lenin and Trotzky, rumour said, were to be excluded....\\n\
\\nAbout noon I was again in front of Smolny, talking with the driver\\nof an \
ambulance bound for the revolutionary front. Could I go with\\nhim? \
Certainly! He was a volunteer, a University student, and as we\\nrolled down \
the street shouted over his shoulder to me phrases of\\nexecrable German: _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Also, gut! Wir nach die Kasernen zu essen\\ngehen!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ I made out that there would be lunch at some \
barracks.\\n\\nOn the Kirotchnaya we turned into an immense courtyard \
surrounded by\\nmilitary buildings, and mounted a dark stairway to a low room \
lit by\\none window. At a long wooden table were seated some twenty soldiers,\
\\neating _shtchi_ (cabbage soup) from a great tin wash-tub with \
wooden\\nspoons, and talking loudly with much laughter.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Welcome to the Battalion Committee of the Sixth \
Reserve Engineers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nBattalion!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
cried my friend, and introduced me as an American\\nSocialist. Whereat every \
one rose to shake my hand, and one old\\nsoldier put his arms around me and \
gave me a hearty kiss. A wooden\\nspoon was produced and I took my place at \
the table. Another tub,\\nfull of _kasha,_ was brought in, a huge loaf of \
black bread, and of\\ncourse the inevitable tea-pots. At once every one began \
asking me\\nquestions about America: Was it true that people in a free \
country\\nsold their votes for _money?_ If so, how did they get what \
they\\nwanted? How about this \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tammany\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]? Was it true that in a free country\\na little group \
of people could control a whole city, and exploited\\nit for their personal \
benefit? Why did the people stand it? Even\\nunder the Tsar such things could \
not happen in Russia; true, here\\nthere was always graft, but to buy and \
sell a whole city full of\\npeople! And in a free country! Had the people no \
revolutionary\\nfeeling? I tried to explain that in my country people tried \
to\\nchange things by law.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Of course,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] nodded a young sergeant, named Baklanov, who \
spoke\\nFrench. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But you have a highly developed \
capitalist class? Then the\\ncapitalist class must control the legislatures \
and the courts. How\\nthen can the people change things? I am open to \
conviction, for I do\\nnot know your country; but to me it is incredible....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nI said that I was going to Tsarskoye Selo. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I, too,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said \
Baklanov,\\nsuddenly. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And I--and I--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The whole roomful decided on the spot to go\\nto \
Tsarskoye Selo.\\n\\nJust then came a knock on the door. It opened, and in it \
stood the\\nfigure of the Colonel. No one rose, but all shouted a greeting. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]May\\nI come in?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked the \
Colonel. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Prosim! Prosim!_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
they answered\\nheartily. He entered, smiling, a tall, distinguished figure \
in a\\ngoat-skin cape embroidered with gold. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I think I \
heard you say that\\nyou were going to Tsarskoye Selo, comrades,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Could I go\\nwith \
you?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBaklanov considered. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I do not think there is anything to be done\\nhere \
to-day,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he answered. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, \
comrade, we shall be very glad to\\nhave you.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The \
Colonel thanked him and sat down, filling a glass of\\ntea.\\n\\nIn a low \
voice, for fear of wounding the Colonel\[CloseCurlyQuote]s pride, \
Baklanov\\nexplained to me. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You see, I am the chairman \
of the Committee. We\\ncontrol the Battalion absolutely, except in action, \
when the Colonel\\nis delegated by us to command. In action his orders must \
be obeyed,\\nbut he is strictly responsible to us. In barracks he must ask \
our\\npermission before taking any action.... You might call him \
our\\nExecutive Officer....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nArms were \
distributed to us, revolvers and rifles--\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we might meet\
\\nsome Cossacks, you know\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--and we all piled into the \
ambulance,\\ntogether with three great bundles of newspapers for the \
front.\\nStraight down the Liteiny we rattled, and along the \
Zagorodny\\nProspekt. Next to me sat a youth with the shoulder-straps of \
a\\nLieutenant, who seemed to speak all European languages with \
equal\\nfluency. He was a member of the Battalion Committee.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am not a Bolshevik,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
assured me, emphatically. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]My family is a\\nvery \
ancient and noble one. I, myself, am, you might say, a Cadet....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But how--?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I began, bewildered.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, \
yes, I am a member of the Committee. I make no secret of my\\npolitical \
opinions, but the others do not mind, because they know I\\ndo not believe in \
opposing the will of the majority.... I have refused\\nto take any action in \
the present civil war, however, for I do not\\nbelieve in taking up arms \
against my brother Russians....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Provocator! Kornilovitz!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the \
others cried at him gaily, slapping\\nhim on the shoulder....\\n\\nPassing \
under the huge grey stone archway of the Moskovsky Gate,\\ncovered with \
golden hieroglyphics, ponderous Imperial eagles and the\\nnames of Tsars, we \
sped out on the wide straight highway, grey with\\nthe first light fall of \
snow. It was thronged with Red Guards,\\nstumbling along on foot toward the \
revolutionary front, shouting and\\nsinging; and others, greyfaced and muddy, \
coming back. Most of them\\nseemed to be mere boys. Women with spades, some \
with rifles and\\nbandoleers, others wearing the Red Cross on their \
arm-bands--the\\nbowed, toil-worn women of the slums. Squads of soldiers \
marching out\\nof step, with an affectionate jeer for the Red Guards; \
sailors,\\ngrim-looking; children with bundles of food for their fathers \
and\\nmothers; all these, coming and going, trudged through the \
whitened\\nmud that covered the cobbles of the highway inches deep. We passed\
\\ncannon, jingling southward with their caissons; trucks bound both\\nways, \
bristling with armed men; ambulances full of wounded from the\\ndirection of \
the battle, and once a peasant cart, creaking slowly\\nalong, in which sat a \
white-faced boy bent over his shattered\\nstomach and screaming monotonously. \
In the fields on either side\\nwomen and old men were digging trenches and \
stringing barbed wire\\nentanglements.\\n\\nBack northward the clouds rolled \
away dramatically, and the pale sun\\ncame out. Across the flat, marshy plain \
Petrograd glittered. To the\\nright, white and gilded and coloured bulbs and \
pinnacles; to the\\nleft, tall chimneys, some pouring out black smoke; and \
beyond, a\\nlowering sky over Finland. On each side of us were \
churches,\\nmonasteries.... Occasionally a monk was visible, silently \
watching the\\npulse of the proletarian army throbbing on the road.\\n\\nAt \
Pulkovo the road divided, and there we halted in the midst of a\\ngreat \
crowd, where the human streams poured from three directions,\\nfriends \
meeting, excited and congratulatory, describing the battle\\nto one another. \
A row of houses facing the cross-roads was marked\\nwith bullets, and the \
earth was trampled into mud half a mile\\naround. The fighting had been \
furious here.... In the near distance\\nriderless Cossack horses circled \
hungrily, for the grass of the\\nplain had died long ago. Right in front of \
us an awkward Red Guard\\nwas trying to ride one, falling off again and \
again, to the\\nchildlike delight of a thousand rough men.\\n\\nThe left \
road, along which the remnants of the Cossacks had\\nretreated, led up a \
little hill to a hamlet, where there was a\\nglorious view of the immense \
plain, grey as a windless sea,\\ntumultuous clouds towering over, and the \
imperial city disgorging\\nits thousands along all the roads. Far over to the \
left lay the\\nlittle hill of Kranoye Selo, the parade-ground of the Imperial\
\\nGuards\[CloseCurlyQuote] summer camp, and the Imperial Dairy. In the \
middle distance\\nnothing broke the flat monotony but a few walled \
monasteries and\\nconvents, some isolated factories, and several large \
buildings with\\nunkempt grounds that were asylums and orphanages....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Here,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the driver, as we \
went on over a barren hill, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]here was\\nwhere Vera \
Slutskaya died. Yes, the Bolshevik member of the Duma. It\\nhappened early \
this morning. She was in an automobile, with Zalkind\\nand another man. There \
was a truce, and they started for the front\\ntrenches. They were talking and \
laughing, when all of a sudden, from\\nthe armoured train in which Kerensky \
himself was riding, somebody\\nsaw the automobile and fired a cannon. The \
shell struck Vera\\nSlutskaya and killed \
her....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAnd so we came into Tsarskoye, all \
bustling with the swaggering\\nheroes of the proletarian horde. Now the \
palace where the Soviet had\\nmet was a busy place. Red Guards and sailors \
filled the court-yard,\\nsentries stood at the doors, and a stream of \
couriers and Commissars\\npushed in and out. In the Soviet room a samovar had \
been set up, and\\nfifty or more workers, soldiers, sailors and officers \
stood around,\\ndrinking tea and talking at the top of their voices. In one \
corner\\ntwo clumsy-handed workingmen were trying to make a \
multigraphing\\nmachine go. At the centre table, the huge Dybenko bent over a \
map,\\nmarking out positions for the troops with red and blue pencils. \
In\\nhis free hand he carried, as always, the enormous bluesteel\\nrevolver. \
Anon he sat himself down at a typewriter and pounded away\\nwith one finger; \
every little while he would pause, pick up the\\nrevolver, and lovingly spin \
the chamber.\\n\\nA couch lay along the wall, and on this was stretched a \
young\\nworkman. Two Red Guards were bending over him, but the rest of \
the\\ncompany did not pay any attention. In his breast was a hole; \
through\\nhis clothes fresh blood came welling up with every heart-beat. \
His\\neyes were closed and his young, bearded face was \
greenish-white.\\nFaintly and slowly he still breathed, with every breath \
sighing,\\n_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mir boudit! Mir boudit!_ (Peace is coming! \
Peace is coming!)\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDybenko looked up as we came \
in. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Ah,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said to \
Baklanov.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrade, will you go up to the Commandant\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s headquarters and take\\ncharge? Wait; I will write you \
credentials.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He went to the\\ntypewriter and slowly \
picked out the letters.\\n\\nThe new Commandant of Tsarskoye Selo and I went \
toward the Ekaterina\\nPalace, Baklanov very excited and important. In the \
same ornate,\\nwhite room some Red Guards were rummaging curiously around, \
while my\\nold friend, the Colonel, stood by the window biting his moustache.\
\\nHe greeted me like a long-lost brother. At a table near the door sat\\nthe \
French Bessarabian. The Bolsheviki had ordered him to remain,\\nand continue \
his work.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What could I \
do?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he muttered. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]People like \
myself cannot fight on\\neither side in such a war as this, no matter how \
much we may\\ninstinctively dislike the dictatorship of the mob.... I only \
regret\\nthat I am so far from my mother in Bessarabia!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBaklanov was formally taking over the office \
from the Commandant.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Here,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
said the Colonel nervously, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]are the keys to the desk.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA Red Guard interrupted. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the money?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he asked rudely. The\\nColonel seemed surprised. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Money? Money? Ah, you mean the chest.\\nThere it is,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the Colonel, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]just as I \
found it when I took\\npossession three days ago. Keys?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The Colonel shrugged. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I have \
no\\nkeys.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Red Guard sneered knowingly. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Very convenient,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
said.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let us open the chest,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Baklanov. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bring an axe. \
Here is an\\nAmerican comrade. Let him smash the chest open, and write down \
what\\nhe finds there.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nI swung the axe. The \
wooden chest was empty.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
arrest him,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the Red Guard, venomously. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]He is\\nKerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s man. He has stolen \
the money and given it to Kerensky.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBaklanov did \
not want to. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Oh, no,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was the Kornilovitz\\nbefore him. He is not to \
blame.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The devil!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried \
the Red Guard. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]He is Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s man, \
I tell you.\\nIf _you_ won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t arrest him, then _we_ will, and \
we\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll take him to\\nPetrograd and put him in Peter-Paul, \
where he belongs!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At this the\\nother Red Guards \
growled assent. With a piteous glance at us the\\nColonel was led away....\\n\
\\nDown in front of the Soviet palace an auto-truck was going to the\\nfront. \
Half a dozen Red Guards, some sailors, and a soldier or two,\\nunder command \
of a huge workman, clambered in, and shouted to me to\\ncome along. Red \
Guards issued from headquarters, each of them\\nstaggering under an arm-load \
of small, corrugated-iron bombs, filled\\nwith _grubit_--which, they say, is \
ten times as strong, and five\\ntimes as sensitive as dynamite; these they \
threw into the truck. A\\nthree-inch cannon was loaded and then tied onto the \
tail of the\\ntruck with bits of rope and wire.\\n\\nWe started with a shout, \
at top speed of course; the heavy truck\\nswaying from side to side. The \
cannon leaped from one wheel to the\\nother, and the _grubit_ bombs went \
rolling back and forth over our\\nfeet, fetching up against the sides of the \
car with a crash.\\n\\nThe big Red Guard, whose name was Vladimir \
Nicolaievitch, plied me\\nwith questions about America. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why did America come into the war?\\nAre the American \
workers ready to throw over the capitalists? What\\nis the situation in the \
Mooney case now? Will they extradite Berkman\\nto San Francisco?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and other, very difficult to answer, all\\ndelivered \
in a shout above the roaring of the truck, while we held\\non to each other \
and danced amid the caroming bombs.\\n\\nOccasionally a patrol tried to stop \
us. Soldiers ran out into the\\nroad before us, shouted _\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shtoi!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_ and threw up their \
guns.\\n\\nWe paid no attention. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The devil take you!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried the Red Guards.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t stop for anybody! We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re Red Guards!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] And we thundered\\nimperiously on, while Vladimir \
Nicolaievitch bellowed to me about\\nthe internationalisation of the Panama \
Canal, and such matters....\\n\\nAbout five miles out we saw a squad of \
sailors marching back, and\\nslowed down.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Where\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the front, brothers?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
foremost sailor halted and scratched his head. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This \
morning,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nhe said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]it was \
about half a kilometer down the road. But the damn\\nthing isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t anywhere now. We walked and walked and walked, but \
we\\ncouldn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t find it.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThey \
climbed into the truck, and we proceeded. It must have been\\nabout a mile \
further that Vladimir Nicolaievitch cocked his ear and\\nshouted to the \
chauffeur to \
stop.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Firing!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do you hear it?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] For a moment \
dead silence, and\\nthen, a little ahead and to the left, three shots in \
rapid\\nsuccession. Along here the side of the road was heavily wooded. \
Very\\nmuch excited now, we crept along, speaking in whispers, until \
the\\ntruck was nearly opposite the place where the firing had come \
from.\\nDescending, we spread out, and every man carrying his rifle, \
went\\nstealthily into the forest.\\n\\nTwo comrades, meanwhile, detached the \
cannon and slewed it around\\nuntil it aimed as nearly as possible at our \
backs.\\n\\nIt was silent in the woods. The leaves were gone, and \
the\\ntree-trunks were a pale wan colour in the low, sickly autumn sun.\\nNot \
a thing moved, except the ice of little woodland pools shivering\\nunder our \
feet. Was it an ambush?\\n\\nWe went uneventfully forward until the trees \
began to thin, and\\npaused. Beyond, in a little clearing, three soldiers sat \
around a\\nsmall fire, perfectly oblivious.\\n\\nVladimir Nicolaievitch \
stepped forward. _\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Zra\[CloseCurlyQuote]zvuitye,_ \
comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nhe greeted, while behind him one cannon, \
twenty rifles and a\\ntruck-load of _grubit_ bombs hung by a hair. The \
soldiers scrambled\\nto their feet.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What was the \
shooting going on around here?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOne of the \
soldiers answered, looking relieved, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why we were \
just\\nshooting a rabbit or two, comrade....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
truck hurtled on toward Romanov, through the bright, empty day.\\nAt the \
first cross-roads two soldiers ran out in front of us, waving\\ntheir rifles. \
We slowed down, and stopped.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Passes, comrades!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Red Guards raised a great clamour. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are Red Guards. We don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nneed \
any passes.... Go on, never mind them!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBut a \
sailor objected. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is wrong, comrades. We must have\
\\nrevolutionary discipline. Suppose some counterrevolutionaries came\\nalong \
in a truck and said: \[OpenCurlyQuote]We don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t need any \
passes?\[CloseCurlyQuote] The comrades\\ndon\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know you.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt this there was a debate. One by one, \
however, the sailors and\\nsoldiers joined with the first. Grumbling, each \
Red Guard produced\\nhis dirty _bumaga_ (paper). All were alike except mine, \
which had\\nbeen issued by the Revolutionary Staff at Smolny. The \
sentries\\ndeclared that I must go with them. The Red Guards \
objected\\nstrenuously, but the sailor who had spoken first insisted. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This\\ncomrade we know to be a true comrade,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But there \
are\\norders of the Committee, and these orders must be obeyed. That \
is\\nrevolutionary discipline....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn order not \
to make any trouble, I got down from the truck, and\\nwatched it disappear \
careening down the road, all the company waving\\nfarewell. The soldiers \
consulted in low tones for a moment, and then\\nled me to a wall, against \
which they placed me. It flashed upon me\\nsuddenly; they were going to shoot \
me!\\n\\nIn all three directions not a human being was in sight. The \
only\\nsign of life was smoke from the chimney of a _datchya,_ a \
rambling\\nwooden house a quarter of a mile up the side road. The two \
soldiers\\nwere walking out into the road. Desperately I ran after \
them.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But comrades! See! Here is the seal of the \
Military Revolutionary\\nCommittee!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThey stared \
stupidly at my pass, then at each other.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is \
different from the others,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said one, sullenly. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We cannot\\nread, \
brother.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nI took him by the arm. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Come!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let\[CloseCurlyQuote]s go to that house. Some\\none \
there can surely read.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] They hesitated. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said one. The\\nother \
looked me over. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why not?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
muttered. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]After all, it is a\\nserious crime to kill \
an innocent man.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe walked up to the front door \
of the house and knocked. A short,\\nstout woman opened it, and shrank back \
in alarm, babbling, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t\\nknow \
anything about them! I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know anything about them!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] One of\\nmy guards held out the pass. She screamed. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Just to read it,\\ncomrade.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Hesitatingly she took the paper and read aloud, swiftly:\\n\\nThe bearer of \
this pass, John Reed, is a representative of the\\nAmerican Social-Democracy, \
an internationalist....\\n\\nOut on the road again the two soldiers held \
another consultation.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We must take you to the \
Regimental Committee,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they said. In \
the\\nfast-deepening twilight we trudged along the muddy road.\\nOccasionally \
we met squads of soldiers, who stopped and surrounded\\nme with looks of \
menace, handling my pass around and arguing\\nviolently as to whether or not \
I should be killed....\\n\\nIt was dark when we came to the barracks of the \
Second Tsarskoye\\nSelo Rifles, low sprawling buildings huddled along the \
post-road. A\\nnumber of soldiers slouching at the entrance asked eager \
questions.\\nA spy? A provocator? We mounted a winding stair and emerged into \
a\\ngreat, bare room with a huge stove in the centre, and rows of cots\\non \
the floor, where about a thousand soldiers were playing cards,\\ntalking, \
singing, and asleep. In the roof was a jagged hole made by\\nKerensky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s cannon....\\n\\nI stood in the doorway, and a sudden \
silence ran among the groups,\\nwho turned and stared at me. Of a sudden they \
began to move, slowly\\nand then with a rush, thundering, with faces full of \
hate.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! Comrades!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
yelled one of my guards. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Committee!\\nCommittee!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The throng halted, banked around me, muttering. Out \
of\\nthem shouldered a lean youth, wearing a red arm-band.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who is this?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he asked roughly. \
The guards explained. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Give me the\\npaper!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He read it carefully, glancing at me with keen eyes. \
Then he\\nsmiled and handed me the pass. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades, \
this is an American\\ncomrade. I am Chairman of the Committee, and I welcome \
you to the\\nRegiment....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] A sudden general buzz grew \
into a roar of greeting, and\\nthey pressed forward to shake my hand.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You have not dined? Here we have had our dinner. You \
shall go to\\nthe Officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Club, where there are some who \
speak your language....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe led me across the \
court-yard to the door of another building. An\\naristocratic-looking youth, \
with the shoulder straps of a\\nLieutenant, was entering. The Chairman \
presented me, and shaking\\nhands, went back.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I \
am Stepan Georgevitch Morovsky, at your service,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said \
the\\nLieutenant, in perfect French. From the ornate entrance hall \
a\\nceremonial staircase led upward, lighted by glittering lustres. On\\nthe \
second floor billiard-rooms, card-rooms, a library opened from\\nthe hall. We \
entered the dining-room, at a long table in the centre\\nof which sat about \
twenty officers in full uniform, wearing their\\ngold- and silver-handled \
swords, the ribbons and crosses of Imperial\\ndecorations. All rose politely \
as I entered, and made a place for me\\nbeside the Colonel, a large, \
impressive man with a grizzled beard.\\nOrderlies were deftly serving dinner. \
The atmosphere was that of any\\nofficers\[CloseCurlyQuote] mess in Europe. \
Where was the Revolution?\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are not Bolsheviki?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] I asked Morovsky.\\n\\nA smile went around the \
table, but I caught one or two glancing\\nfurtively at the orderly.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered my friend. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There is only one Bolshevik officer in\\nthis \
regiment. He is in Petrograd to-night. The Colonel is a\\nMenshevik. Captain \
Kherlov there is a Cadet. I myself am a Socialist\\nRevolutionary of the \
right wing.... I should say that most of the\\nofficers in the Army are not \
Bolsheviki, but like me they believe in\\ndemocracy; they believe that they \
must follow the soldier-masses....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDinner over, \
maps were brought, and the Colonel spread them out on\\nthe table. The rest \
crowded around to see.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Here,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the Colonel, pointing to pencil marks, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]were our\\npositions this morning. Vladimir \
Kyrilovitch, where is your company?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nCaptain \
Kherlov pointed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]According to orders, we occupied \
the\\nposition along this road. Karsavin relieved me at five o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nJust then the door of \
the room opened, and there entered the\\nChairman of the Regimental \
Committee, with another soldier. They\\njoined the group behind the Colonel, \
peering at the map.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Good,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
said the Colonel. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now the Cossacks have fallen back \
ten\\nkilometres in our sector. I do not think it is necessary to take \
up\\nadvanced positions. Gentlemen, for to-night you will hold the\\npresent \
line, strengthening the positions by--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If you please,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] interrupted the \
Chairman of the Regimental\\nCommittee. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The orders are \
to advance with all speed, and prepare to\\nengage the Cossacks north of \
Gatchina in the morning. A crushing\\ndefeat is necessary. Kindly make the \
proper dispositions.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThere was a short silence. \
The Colonel again turned to the map.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Very well,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, in a different voice. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Stepan Georgevitch, you\\nwill please--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Rapidly tracing lines with a blue pencil, he gave \
his\\norders, while a sergeant made shorthand notes. The sergeant \
then\\nwithdrew, and ten minutes later returned with the \
orders\\ntypewritten, and one carbon copy. The Chairman of the \
Committee\\nstudied the map with a copy of the orders before him.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All right,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, rising. \
Folding the carbon copy, he put it in\\nhis pocket. Then he signed the other, \
stamped it with a round seal\\ntaken from his pocket, and presented it to the \
Colonel....\\n\\nHere was the Revolution!\\n\\nI returned to the Soviet \
palace in Tsarskoye in the Regimental Staff\\nautomobile. Still the crowds of \
workers, soldiers and sailors\\npouring in and out, still the choking press \
of trucks, armoured\\ncars, cannon before the door, and the shouting, the \
laughter of\\nunwonted victory. Half a dozen Red Guards forced their way \
through,\\na priest in the middle. This was Father Ivan, they said, who \
had\\nblessed the Cossacks when they entered the town. I heard \
afterward\\nthat he was shot.... (See App. IX, Sect. 4)\\n\\nDybenko was just \
coming out, giving rapid orders right and left. In\\nhis hand he carried the \
big revolver. An automobile stood with\\nracing engine at the kerb. Alone, he \
climbed in the rear seat, and\\nwas off-off to Gatchina, to conquer Kerensky.\
\\n\\nToward nightfall he arrived at the outskirts of the town, and went\\non \
afoot. What Dybenko told the Cossacks nobody knows, but the fact\\nis that \
General Krasnov and his staff and several thousand Cossacks\\nsurrendered, \
and advised Kerensky to do the same. (See App. IX,\\nSect. 5)\\n\\nAs for \
Kerensky--I reprint here the deposition made by General\\nKrasnov on the \
morning of November 14th:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Gatchina, November 14, \
1917. To-day, about three o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock (A. M.), I\\nwas summoned \
by the Supreme Commander (Kerensky). He was very\\nagitated, and very \
nervous.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]General,\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] he said to me, \[OpenCurlyQuote]you have betrayed me. Your \
Cossacks\\ndeclare categorically that they will arrest me and deliver me to \
the\\nsailors.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]\
Yes,\[CloseCurlyQuote] I answered, \[OpenCurlyQuote]there is talk of it, and \
I know that you have\\nno sympathy anywhere.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]But the officers say the same thing.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Yes, most of \
all it is the officers who are discontented with you.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]What shall I do? I ought to commit \
suicide!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]If \
you are an honorable man, you will go immediately to Petrograd\\nwith a white \
flag, you will present yourself to the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee, \
and enter into negotiations as Chief of the\\nProvisional Government.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]All right. I \
will do that, General.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]I will give you a guard and ask that a sailor go with you.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]No, no, not a \
sailor. Do you know whether it is true that Dybenko\\nis here?\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]I don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know who Dybenko is.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]He is my enemy.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]There is nothing to do. If you play \
for high stakes you must know\\nhow to take a chance.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Yes. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll leave \
to-night!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Why? \
That would be a flight. Leave calmly and openly, so that\\nevery one can see \
that you are not running away.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Very well. But you must give me a guard on which I can \
count.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Good.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I went out and called the \
Cossack Russkov, of the Tenth Regiment of\\nthe Don, and ordered him to pick \
out ten Cossacks to accompany the\\nSupreme Commander. Half an hour later the \
Cossacks came to tell me\\nthat Kerensky was not in his quarters, that he had \
run away.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I gave the alarm and ordered that he be \
searched for, supposing\\nthat he could not have left Gatchina, but he could \
not be found....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAnd so Kerensky fled, alone, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]disguised in the uniform of a sailor,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nand by that act lost whatever popularity he had \
retained among the\\nRussian masses....\\n\\nI went back to Petrograd riding \
on the front seat of an auto truck,\\ndriven by a workman and filled with Red \
Guards. We had no kerosene,\\nso our lights were not burning. The road was \
crowded with the\\nproletarian army going home, and new reserves pouring out \
to take\\ntheir places. Immense trucks like ours, columns of \

We\\nhurtled furiously on, wrenched right and left to avoid collisions\\nthat \
seemed inevitable, scraping wheels, followed by the epithets \
of\\npedestrians.\\n\\nAcross the horizon spread the glittering lights of the \
capital,\\nimmeasurably more splendid by night than by day, like a dike \

14th.\\n\\nTo all Army, corps, divisional and regimental Committees, to \
all\\nSoviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, to all, all,\\nall.\\n\\nConforming to \
the agreement between the Cossacks, _yunkers,_\\nsoldiers, sailors and \
workers, it has been decided to arraign\\nAlexander Feodorvitch Kerensky \
before a tribunal of the people. We\\ndemand that Kerensky be arrested, and \
that he be ordered, in the name\\nof the organisations hereinafter mentioned, \
to come immediately to\\nPetrograd and present himself to the \
tribunal.\\n\\nSigned,\\n\\n_The Cossacks of the First Division of Ussuri \

\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar DYBENKO.\\n\\nThe Committee for Salvation, the \
Duma, the Central Committee of the\\nSocialist Revolutionary party--proudly \
claiming Kerensky as a\\nmember--all passionately protested that he could \
only be held\\nresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.\\n\\nOn the evening \
of November 16th I watched two thousand Red Guards\\nswing down the Zagorodny \
Prospekt behind a military band playing the\\n_Marseillaise_--and how \
appropriate it sounded--with blood-red flags\\nover the dark ranks of \
workmen, to welcome home again their brothers\\nwho had defended \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Red Petrograd.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] In the bitter \
dusk they tramped,\\nmen and women, their tall bayonets swaying; through \
streets faintly\\nlighted and slippery with mud, between silent crowds of \
bourgeois,\\ncontemptuous but fearful....\\n\\nAll were against \
them--business men, speculators, investors,\\nland-owners, army officers, \
politicians, teachers, students,\\nprofessional men, shop-keepers, clerks, \
agents. The other Socialist\\nparties hated the Bolsheviki with an implacable \
hatred. On the side\\nof the Soviets were the rank and file of the workers, \
the sailors,\\nall the undemoralised soldiers, the landless peasants, and a \
few--a\\nvery few--intellectuals....\\n\\nFrom the farthest corners of great \
Russia, whereupon desperate\\nstreet-fighting burst like a wave, news of \
Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s defeat came\\nechoing back the immense roar of \
proletarian victory. Kazan, Saratov,\\nNovgorod, Vinnitza--where the streets \
had run with blood; Moscow,\\nwhere the Bolsheviki had turned their artillery \
against the last\\nstrong-hold of the bourgeoisie--the Kremlin.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They are bombarding the Kremlin!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The news passed from mouth to\\nmouth in the streets \
of Petrograd, almost with a sense of terror.\\nTravellers from \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]white and shining little mother Moscow\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] told fearful\\ntales. Thousands killed; the \
Tverskaya and the Kuznetsky Most in\\nflames; the church of Vasili Blazheiny \
a smoking ruin; Usspensky\\nCathedral crumbling down; the Spasskaya Gate of \
the Kremlin\\ntottering; the Duma burned to the ground. (See App. X, Sect. 1)\
\\n\\nNothing that the Bolsheviki had done could compare with this \
fearful\\nblasphemy in the heart of Holy Russia. To the ears of the \
devout\\nsounded the shock of guns crashing in the face of the Holy \
Orthodox\\nChurch, and pounding to dust the sanctuary of the Russian \
nation....\\n\\nOn November 15th, Lunatcharsky, Commissar of Education, broke \
into\\ntears at the session of the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars, and\\nrushed from the room, crying, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I \
cannot stand it! I cannot bear the\\nmonstrous destruction of beauty and \
tradition....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThat afternoon his letter of \
resignation was published in the\\nnewspapers:\\n\\nI have just been \
informed, by people arriving from Moscow, what has\\nhappened there.\\n\\nThe \
Cathedral of St. Basil the Blessed, the Cathedral of the\\nAssumption, are \
being bombarded. The Kremlin, where are now gathered\\nthe most important art \
treasures of Petrograd and of Moscow, is under\\nartillery fire. There are \
thousands of victims.\\n\\nThe fearful struggle there has reached a pitch of \
bestial ferocity.\\n\\nWhat is left? What more can happen?\\n\\nI cannot bear \
this. My cup is full. I am unable to endure these\\nhorrors. It is impossible \
to work under the pressure of thoughts\\nwhich drive me mad!\\n\\nThat is why \
I am leaving the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\\nI \
fully realise the gravity of this decision. But I can bear no\\nmore.... (See \
App. X, Sect. 2)\\n\\nThat same day the White Guards and _yunkers_ in the \
Kremlin\\nsurrendered, and were allowed to march out unharmed. The treaty \
of\\npeace follows:\\n\\n1. The Committee of Public Safety ceases to \
exist.\\n\\n2. The White Guard gives up its arms and dissolves. The \
officers\\nretain their swords and regulations side-arms. In the \
Military\\nSchools are retained only the arms necessary for instruction; \
all\\nothers are surrendered by the _yunkers._ The Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee guarantees the liberty and inviolability of the \
person.\\n\\n3. To settle the question of disarmament, as set forth in \
section 2,\\na special commission is appointed, consisting of representatives \
from\\nall organisations which took part in the peace negotiations.\\n\\n4. \
From the moment of the signature of this peace treaty, both\\nparties shall \
immediately give order to cease firing and halt all\\nmilitary operations, \
taking measures to ensure punctual obedience to\\nthis order.\\n\\n5. At the \
signature of the treaty, all prisoners made by the two\\nparties shall be \
released....\\n\\nFor two days now the Bolsheviki had been in control of the \
city. The\\nfrightened citizens were creeping out of their cellars to seek \
their\\ndead; the barricades in the streets were being removed. Instead \
of\\ndiminishing, however, the stories of destruction in Moscow \
continued\\nto grow.... And it was under the influence of these fearful \
reports\\nthat we decided to go there.\\n\\nPetrograd, after all, in spite of \
being for a century the seat of\\nGovernment, is still an artificial city. \
Moscow is real Russia,\\nRussia as it was and will be; in Moscow we would get \
the true feeling\\nof the Russian people about the Revolution. Life was more \
intense\\nthere.\\n\\nFor the past week the Petrograd Military Revolutionary \
Committee,\\naided by the rank and file of the Railway Workers, had seized \
control\\nof the Nicolai Railroad, and hurled trainload after trainload \
of\\nsailors and Red Guards southwest.... We were provided with passes \
from\\nSmolny, without which no one could leave the capital.... When the \
train\\nbacked into the station, a mob of shabby soldiers, all carrying \
huge\\nsacks of eatables, stormed the doors, smashed the windows, and \
poured\\ninto all the compartments, filling up the aisles and even \
climbing\\nonto the roof. Three of us managed to wedge our way into \
a\\ncompartment, but almost immediately about twenty soldiers \
entered....\\nThere was room for only four people; we argued, expostulated, \
and the\\nconductor joined us--but the soldiers merely laughed. Were they \
to\\nbother about the comfort of a lot of _boorzhui_ (bourgeois)? \
We\\nproduced the passes from Smolny; instantly the soldiers changed \
their\\nattitude.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Come, comrades,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried one, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]these are American \
_tovarishtchi._ They\\nhave come thirty thousand versts to see our \
Revolution, and they are\\nnaturally \
tired....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWith polite and friendly apologies the \
soldiers began to leave.\\nShortly afterward we heard them breaking into a \
compartment occupied\\nby two stout, well-dressed Russians, who had bribed \
the conductor and\\nlocked their door....\\n\\nAbout seven \
o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in the evening we drew out of the station, \
an\\nimmense long train drawn by a weak little locomotive burning wood,\\nand \
stumbled along slowly, with many stops. The soldiers on the roof\\nkicked \
with their heels and sang whining peasant songs; and in the\\ncorridor, so \
jammed that it was impossible to pass, violent political\\ndebates raged all \
night long. Occasionally the conductor came\\nthrough, as a matter of habit, \
looking for tickets. He found very few\\nexcept ours, and after a half-hour \
of futile wrangling, lifted his\\narms despairingly and withdrew. The \
atmosphere was stifling, full of\\nsmoke and foul odours; if it hadn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t been for the broken windows we\\nwould doubtless have \
smothered during the night.\\n\\nIn the morning, hours late, we looked out \
upon a snowy world. It was\\nbitter cold. About noon a peasant woman got on \
with a basket-full of\\nbread-chunks and a great can of luke warm \
coffee-substitute. From\\nthen on until dark there was nothing but the packed \
train, jolting\\nand stopping, and occasional stations where a ravenous mob \
swooped\\ndown on the scantily-furnished buffet and swept it clean.... At one \
of\\nthese halts I ran into Nogin and Rykov, the seceding Commissars, \
who\\nwere returning to Moscow to put their grievances before their \
own\\nSoviet, and further along was Bukharin, a short, red-bearded man\\nwith \
the eyes of a fanatic--\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]more Left than Lenin,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they said of him....\\n\\nThen the three strokes of \
the bell and we made a rush for the train,\\nworming our way through the \
packed and noisy aisle.... A good-natured\\ncrowd, bearing the discomfort \
with humorous patience, interminably\\narguing about everything from the \
situation in Petrograd to the\\nBritish Trade-Union system, and disputing \
loudly with the few\\n_boorzhui_ who were on board. Before we reached Moscow \
almost every\\ncar had organised a Committee to secure and distribute food, \
and\\nthese Committees became divided into political factions, who \
wrangled\\nover fundamental principles....\\n\\nThe station at Moscow was \
deserted. We went to the office of the\\nCommissar, in order to arrange for \
our return tickets. He was a\\nsullen youth with the shoulder-straps of a \
Lieutenant; when we showed\\nhim our papers from Smolny, he lost his temper \
and declared that he\\nwas no Bolshevik, that he represented the Committee of \
Public\\nSafety.... It was characteristic--in the general turmoil attending \
the\\nconquest of the city, the chief railway station had been forgotten \
by\\nthe victors....\\n\\nNot a cab in sight. A few blocks down the street, \
however, we woke up\\na grotesquely-padded _izvostchik_ asleep upright on the \
box of his\\nlittle sleigh. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How much to the centre of \
the town?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe scratched his head. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The _barini_ won\[CloseCurlyQuote]t be able to find a \
room in\\nany hotel,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll take you around for a \
hundred\\nrubles....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Before the Revolution it cost \
_two!_ We objected, but he\\nsimply shrugged his shoulders. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It takes a good deal of courage to\\ndrive a sleigh \
nowadays,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he went on. We could not beat him \
down\\nbelow fifty.... As we sped along the silent, snowy \
half-lighted\\nstreets, he recounted his adventures during the six days\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] fighting.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Driving along, or \
waiting for a fare on the corner,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all\\nof a sudden _pooff!_ a cannon ball exploding \
here, _pooff!_ a cannon\\nball there, _ratt-ratt!_ a machine-gun.... I \
gallop, the devils\\nshooting all around. I get to a nice quiet street and \
stop, doze a\\nlittle, _pooff!_ another cannon ball, _ratt-ratt_.... Devils! \
Devils!\\nDevils! Brrr!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the centre of the \
town the snow-piled streets were quiet with the\\nstillness of convalescence. \
Only a few arc-lights were burning, only\\na few pedestrians hurried along \
the side-walks. An icy wind blew from\\nthe great plain, cutting to the bone. \
At the first hotel we entered\\nan office illuminated by two candles.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, we have some very comfortable rooms, but all the \
windows are\\nshot out. If the _gospodin_ does not mind a little fresh \
air....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDown the Tverskaya the shop-windows were \
broken, and there were\\nshell-holes and torn-up paving stones in the street. \
Hotel after\\nhotel, all full, or the proprietors still so frightened that \
all they\\ncould say was, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No, no, there is no room! \
There is no room!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] On the\\nmain streets, where the \
great banking-houses and mercantile houses\\nlay, the Bolshevik artillery had \
been indiscriminately effective. As\\none Soviet official told me, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Whenever we didn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know just where \
the\\n_yunkers_ and White Guards were, we bombarded their pocketbooks....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt the big Hotel National they finally took us \
in; for we were\\nforeigners, and the Military Revolutionary Committee had \
promised to\\nprotect the dwellings of foreigners.... On the top floor the \
manager\\nshowed us where shrapnel had shattered several windows. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The\\nanimals!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he, \
shaking his first at imaginary Bolsheviki. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But\\nwait! \
Their time will come; in just a few days now their ridiculous\\nGovernment \
will fall, and then we shall make them \
suffer!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWe dined at a vegetarian restaurant with \
the enticing name, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I Eat\\nNobody,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and Tolstoy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s picture prominent on \
the walls, and then\\nsallied out into the streets.\\n\\nThe headquarters of \
the Moscow Soviet was in the palace of the former\\nGovernor-General, an \
imposing white building fronting Skobeliev\\nSquare. Red Guards stood sentry \
at the door. At the head of the wide,\\nformal stairway, whose walls were \
plastered with announcements of\\ncommittee-meetings and addresses of \
political parties, we passed\\nthrough a series of lofty ante-rooms, hung \
with red-shrouded pictures\\nin gold frames, to the splendid state salon, \
with its magnificent\\ncrystal lustres and gilded cornices. A low-voiced hum \
of talk,\\nunderlaid with the whirring bass of a score of sewing \
machines,\\nfilled the place. Huge bolts of red and black cotton cloth \
were\\nunrolled, serpentining across the parqueted floor and over tables, \
at\\nwhich sat half a hundred women, cutting and sewing streamers \
and\\nbanners for the Funeral of the Revolutionary Dead. The faces of \
these\\nwomen were roughened and scarred with life at its most \
difficult;\\nthey worked now sternly, many of them with eyes red from \
weeping....\\nThe losses of the Red Army had been heavy.\\n\\nAt a desk in \
one corner was Rogov, an intelligent, bearded man with\\nglasses, wearing the \
black blouse of a worker. He invited us to march\\nwith the Central Executive \
Committee in the funeral procession next\\nmorning....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is impossible to teach the Socialist \
Revolutionaries and the\\nMensheviki anything!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he \
exclaimed. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They compromise from sheer\\nhabit. \
Imagine! They proposed that we hold a joint funeral with the\\n_yunkers!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]_\\n\\n[Graphic, page 251: Questionaire for the \
Bourgeoioisie]\\n\\nDistributed to all bourgeois households in Moscow by the \
Moscow\\nMilitary Revolutionary Commitee, so as to provide a basis for \
the\\nrequisition of clothing for the Army and the poor workers. \
For\\ntranslation see Appendix 3. (See App. X, Sect. 3)\\n\\nAcross the hall \
came a man in a ragged soldier-coat and _shapka,_\\nwhose face was familiar; \
I recognised Melnichansky, whom I had known\\nas the watch-maker George \
Melcher in Bayonne, New Jersey, during the\\ngreat Standard Oil strike. Now, \
he told me, he was secretary of the\\nMoscow Metal-Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Union, and a Commissar of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee during the \
fighting....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You see me!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
he cried, showing his decrepit clothing. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I was \
with\\nthe boys in the Kremlin when the _yunkers_ came the first time. \
They\\nshut me up in the cellar and swiped my overcoat, my money, watch \
and\\neven the ring on my finger. This is all I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve got to \
wear!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFrom him I learned many details of the \
bloody six-day battle which\\nhad rent Moscow in two. Unlike in Petrograd, in \
Moscow the City Duma\\nhad taken command of the _yunkers_ and White Guards. \
Rudnev, the\\nMayor, and Minor, president of the Duma, had directed the \
activities\\nof the Committee of Public Safety and the troops. \
Riabtsev,\\nCommandant of the city, a man of democratic instincts, had \
hesitated\\nabout opposing the Military Revolutionary Committee; but the Duma \
had\\nforced him.... It was the Mayor who had urged the occupation of \
the\\nKremlin; \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They will never dare fire on you there,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said....\\n\\nOne garrison regiment, badly \
demoralised by long inactivity, had been\\napproached by both sides. The \
regiment held a meeting to decide what\\naction to take. Resolved, that the \
regiment remain neutral, and\\ncontinue its present activities--which \
consisted in peddling rubbers\\nand sunflower seeds!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But worst of all,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said \
Melnichansky, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]we had to organise while we\\nwere \
fighting. The other side knew just what it wanted; but here the\\nsoldiers \
had their Soviet and the workers theirs.... There was a\\nfearful wrangle \
over who should be Commander-in-chief; some regiments\\ntalked for days \
before they decided what to do; and when the officers\\nsuddenly deserted us, \
we had no battle-staff to give orders....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nVivid \
little pictures he gave me. On a cold grey day he had stood at\\na corner of \
the Nikitskaya, which was swept by blasts of machine-gun\\nfire. A throng of \
little boys were gathered there--street waifs who\\nused to be newsboys. \
Shrill, excited as if with a new game, they\\nwaited until the firing \
slackened, and then tried to run across the\\nstreet.... Many were killed, \
but the rest dashed backward and forward,\\nlaughing, daring each \
other....\\n\\nLate in the evening I went to the _Dvorianskoye Sobranie_--the \
Nobles\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nClub--where the Moscow Bolsheviki were to meet and \
consider the report\\nof Nogin, Rykov and the others who had left the Council \
of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars.\\n\\nThe meeting-place was a \
theatre, in which, under the old r\[EAcute]gime, to\\naudiences of officers \
and glittering ladies, amateur presentations of\\nthe latest French comedy \
had once taken place.\\n\\nAt first the place filled with the \
intellectuals--those who lived near\\nthe centre of the town. Nogin spoke, \
and most of his listeners were\\nplainly with him. It was very late before \
the workers arrived; the\\nworking-class quarters were on the outskirts of \
the town, and no\\nstreet-cars were running. But about midnight they began to \
clump up\\nthe stairs, in groups of ten or twenty--big, rough men, in \
coarse\\nclothes, fresh from the battle-line, where they had fought \
like\\ndevils for a week, seeing their comrades fall all about \
them.\\n\\nScarcely had the meeting formally opened before Nogin was assailed\
\\nwith a tempest of jeers and angry shouts. In vain he tried to argue,\\nto \
explain; they would not listen. He had left the Council of\\nPeople\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars; he had deserted his post while the battle was\
\\nraging. As for the bourgeois press, here in Moscow there was no \
more\\nbourgeois press; even the City Duma had been dissolved. (See App. \
X,\\nSect. 4) Bukharin stood up, savage, logical, with a voice \
which\\nplunged and struck, plunged and struck.... Him they listened to \
with\\nshining eyes. Resolution, to support the action of the Council \
of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars, passed by overwhelming majority. \
So spoke\\nMoscow....\\n\\n[Graphic, page 254: Pass to the Kremlin]\\n\\nBy \
this the Military Revolutionary Commitee requests to give a pass\\nfor the \

                        For the Secretary\\n\\nLate in the night we went \
through the empty streets and under the\\nIberian Gate to the great Red \
Square in front of the Kremlin. The\\nchurch of Vasili Blazheiny loomed \
fantastic, its bright-coloured,\\nconvoluted and blazoned cupolas vague in \
the darkness. There was no\\nsign of any damage.... Along one side of the \
square the dark towers and\\nwalls of the Kremlin stood up. On the high walls \
flickered redly the\\nlight of hidden flames; voices reached us across the \
immense place,\\nand the sound of picks and shovels. We crossed \
over.\\n\\nMountains of dirt and rock were piled high near the base of the \
wall.\\nClimbing these we looked down into two massive pits, ten or \
fifteen\\nfeet deep and fifty yards long, where hundreds of soldiers \
and\\nworkers were digging in the light of huge fires.\\n\\nA young student \
spoke to us in German. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Brotherhood Grave,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he\\nexplained. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To-morrow we \
shall bury here five hundred proletarians\\nwho died for the Revolution.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe took us down into the pit. In frantic haste \
swung the picks and\\nshovels, and the earth--mountains grew. No one spoke. \
Overhead the\\nnight was thick with stars, and the ancient Imperial Kremlin \
wall\\ntowered up immeasurably.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Here in this holy \
place,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the student, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]holiest of all Russia,\\nwe shall bury our most holy. \
Here where are the tombs of the Tsars,\\nour Tsar--the People--shall \
sleep....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] His arm was in a sling, from \
a\\nbullet-wound gained in the fighting. He looked at it. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You foreigners\\nlook down on us Russians because so \
long we tolerated a medi\[AE]val\\nmonarchy,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said he. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But we saw that the Tsar was not the only tyrant\\nin \
the world; capitalism was worse, and in all the countries of the\\nworld \
capitalism was Emperor.... Russian revolutionary tactics are\\nbest....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAs we left, the workers in the pit, exhausted \
and running with sweat\\nin spite of the cold, began to climb wearily out. \
Across the Red\\nSquare a dark knot of men came hurrying. They swarmed into \
the pits,\\npicked up the tools and began digging, digging, without a \
word....\\n\\nSo, all the long night volunteers of the People relieved each \
other,\\nnever halting in their driving speed, and the cold light of the dawn\
\\nlaid bare the great Square, white with snow, and the yawning brown\\npits \
of the Brotherhood Grave, quite finished.\\n\\nWe rose before sunrise, and \
hurried through the dark streets to\\nSkobeliev Square. In all the great city \
not a human being could be\\nseen; but there was a faint sound of stirring, \
far and near, like a\\ndeep wind coming. In the pale half-light a little \
group of men and\\nwomen were gathered before the Soviet headquarters, with a \
sheaf of\\ngold-lettered red banners--the Central Executive Committee of \
the\\nMoscow Soviets. It grew light. From afar the vague stirring \
sound\\ndeepened and became louder, a steady and tremendous bass. The \
city\\nwas rising. We set out down the Tverskaya, the banners \
flapping\\noverhead. The little street chapels along our way were locked \
and\\ndark, as was the Chapel of the Iberian Virgin, which each new \
Tsar\\nused to visit before he went to the Kremlin to crown himself, \
and\\nwhich, day or night, was always open and crowded, and brilliant \
with\\nthe candles of the devout gleaming on the gold and silver and \
jewels\\nof the ikons. Now, for the first time since Napoleon was in \
Moscow,\\nthey say, the candles were out.\\n\\nThe Holy Orthodox Church had \
withdrawn the light of its countenance\\nfrom Moscow, the nest of irreverent \
vipers who had bombarded the\\nKremlin. Dark and silent and cold were the \
churches; the priests had\\ndisappeared. There were no popes to officiate at \
the Red Burial,\\nthere had been no sacrament for the dead, nor were any \
prayers to be\\nsaid over the grave of the blasphemers. Tikhon, Metropolitan \
of\\nMoscow, was soon to excommunicate the Soviets....\\n\\nAlso the shops \
were closed, and the propertied classes stayed at\\nhome--but for other \
reasons. This was the Day of the People, the\\nrumour of whose coming was \
thunderous as surf....\\n\\nAlready through the Iberian Gate a human river \
was flowing, and the\\nvast Red Square was spotted with people, thousands of \
them. I\\nremarked that as the throng passed the Iberian Chapel, where always\
\\nbefore the passerby had crossed himself, they did not seem to \
notice\\nit....\\n\\nWe forced our way through the dense mass packed near the \
Kremlin\\nwall, and stood upon one of the dirt-mountains. Already several men\
\\nwere there, among them Muranov, the soldier who had been \
elected\\nCommandant of Moscow--a tall, simple-looking, bearded man with \
a\\ngentle face.\\n\\nThrough all the streets to the Red Square the torrents \
of people\\npoured, thousands upon thousands of them, all with the look of \
the\\npoor and the toiling. A military band came marching up, playing \
the\\n_Internationale,_ and spontaneously the song caught and spread \
like\\nwind-ripples on a sea, slow and solemn. From the top of the \
Kremlin\\nwall gigantic banners unrolled to the ground; red, with great \
letters\\nin gold and in white, saying, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Martyrs of the \
Beginning of World\\nSocial Revolution,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long Live the Brotherhood of Workers of the\\nWorld.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nA bitter wind swept the Square, lifting the \
banners. Now from the far\\nquarters of the city the workers of the different \
factories were\\narriving, with their dead. They could be seen coming through \
the\\nGate, the blare of their banners, and the dull red--like blood--of \
the\\ncoffins they carried. These were rude boxes, made of unplaned \
wood\\nand daubed with crimson, borne high on the shoulders of rough men \
who\\nmarched with tears streaming down their faces, and followed by \
women\\nwho sobbed and screamed, or walked stiffly, with white, dead \
faces.\\nSome of the coffins were open, the lid carried behind them; \
others\\nwere covered with gilded or silvered cloth, or had a soldier\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s hat\\nnailed on the top. There were many wreaths of \
hideous artificial\\nflowers....\\n\\nThrough an irregular lane that opened \
and closed again the procession\\nslowly moved toward us. Now through the \
Gate was flowing an endless\\nstream of banners, all shades of red, with \
silver and gold lettering,\\nknots of crepe hanging from the top--and some \
Anarchist flags, black\\nwith white letters. The band was playing the \
Revolutionary Funeral\\nMarch, and against the immense singing of the mass of \
people,\\nstanding uncovered, the paraders sang hoarsely, choked with \
sobs....\\n\\nBetween the factory-workers came companies of soldiers with \
their\\ncoffins, too, and squadrons of cavalry, riding at salute, \
and\\nartillery batteries, the cannon wound with red and black--forever, \
it\\nseemed. Their banners said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live the Third \
International!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] or\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We Want an \
Honest, General, Democratic Peace!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSlowly the \
marchers came with their coffins to the entrance of the\\ngrave, and the \
bearers clambered up with their burdens and went down\\ninto the pit. Many of \
them were women--squat, strong proletarian\\nwomen. Behind the dead came \
other women--women young and broken, or\\nold, wrinkled women making noises \
like hurt animals, who tried to\\nfollow their sons and husbands into the \
Brotherhood Grave, and\\nshrieked when compassionate hands restrained them. \
The poor love each\\nother so!\\n\\nAll the long day the funeral procession \
passed, coming in by the\\nIberian Gate and leaving the Square by way of the \
Nikolskaya, a river\\nof red banners, bearing words of hope and brotherhood \
and stupendous\\nprophecies, against a back-ground of fifty thousand \
people,--under the\\neyes of the world\[CloseCurlyQuote]s workers and their \
descendants forever....\\n\\nOne by one the five hundred coffins were laid in \
the pits. Dusk fell,\\nand still the banners came drooping and fluttering, \
the band played\\nthe Funeral March, and the huge assemblage chanted. In the \
leafless\\nbranches of the trees above the grave the wreaths were hung, \
like\\nstrange, multi-coloured blossoms. Two hundred men began to shovel \
in\\nthe dirt. It rained dully down upon the coffins with a thudding\\nsound, \
audible beneath the singing....\\n\\nThe lights came out. The last banners \
passed, and the last moaning\\nwomen, looking back with awful intensity as \
they went. Slowly from\\nthe great Square ebbed the proletarian \
tide....\\n\\nI suddenly realised that the devout Russian people no longer \
needed\\npriests to pray them into heaven. On earth they were building \
a\\nkingdom more bright than any heaven had to offer, and for which it\\nwas \
a glory to die....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XI\\n\\nThe Conquest of Power (See \
App. XI, Sect. 1)\\n\\n\\nDECLARATION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA \
(See App. XI,\\nSect. 2)\\n\\n... The first Congress of Soviets, in June of \
this year, proclaimed\\nthe right of the peoples of Russia to \
self-determination.\\n\\nThe second Congress of Soviets, in November last, \
confirmed this\\ninalienable right of the peoples of Russia more decisively \
and\\ndefinitely.\\n\\nExecuting the will of these Congresses, the Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars has resolved to establish as a basis \
for its activity in\\nthe question of Nationalities, the following \
principles:\\n\\n(1) The equality and sovereignty of the peoples of \
Russia.\\n\\n(2) The right of the peoples of Russia to free \
self-determination,\\neven to the point of separation and the formation of an \
independent\\nstate.\\n\\n(3) The abolition of any and all national and \
national religious\\nprivileges and disabilities.\\n\\n(4) The free \
development of national minorities and ethnographic\\ngroups inhabiting the \
territory of Russia.\\n\\nDecrees will be prepared immediately upon the \
formation of a\\nCommission on Nationalities.\\n\\nIn the name of the Russian \
Republic,\\n\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar for \
Nationalities\\n\\nYUSSOV DJUGASHVILI-STALIN\\n\\nPresident of the Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars\\n\\nV. ULIANOV (LENIN)\\n\\nThe Central \
Rada at Kiev immediately declared Ukraine an independent\\nRepublic, as did \
the Government of Finland, through the Senate at\\nHelsingfors. Independent \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Governments\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] spring up in \
Siberia and the\\nCaucasus. The Polish Chief Military Committee swiftly \
gathered\\ntogether the Polish troops in the Russian army, abolished \
their\\nCommittees and established an iron discipline....\\n\\nAll these \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Governments\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]movements\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] had two \
characteristics in\\ncommon; they were controlled by the propertied classes, \
and they\\nfeared and detested Bolshevism....\\n\\nSteadily, amid the chaos \
of shocking change, the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars \
hammered at the scaffolding of the Socialist order.\\nDecree on Social \
Insurance, on Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control, Regulations for\\nVolost \
Land Committees, Abolition of Ranks and Titles, Abolition of\\nCourts and the \
Creation of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Tribunals.... (See App. XI, \
Sect.\\n3)\\n\\nArmy after army, fleet after fleet, sent deputations, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]joyfully to\\ngreet the new Government of the People.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn front of Smolny, one day, I saw a ragged \
regiment just come from\\nthe trenches. The soldiers were drawn up before the \
great gates,\\nthin and grey-faced, looking up at the building as if God were \
in\\nit. Some pointed out the Imperial eagles over the door, \
laughing....\\nRed Guards came to mount guard. All the soldiers turned to \
look,\\ncuriously, as if they had heard of them but never seen them. \
They\\nlaughed good-naturedly and pressed out of line to slap the \
Red\\nGuards on the back, with half-joking, half-admiring \
remarks....\\n\\nThe Provisional Government was no more. On November 15th, in \
all the\\nchurches of the capital, the priests stopped praying for it. But as\
\\nLenin himself told the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ that was \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]only \
the beginning\\nof the conquest of power.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Deprived of \
arms, the opposition, which\\nstill controlled the economic life of the \
country, settled down to\\norganise disorganisation, with all the Russian \
genius for\\ncooperative action--to obstruct, cripple and discredit the \
Soviets.\\n\\nThe strike of Government employees was well organised, financed \
by\\nthe banks and commercial establishments. Every move of the\\nBolsheviki \
to take over the Government apparatus was resisted.\\n\\nTrotzky went to the \
Ministry of Foreign Affairs; the functionaries\\nrefused to recognise him, \
locked themselves in, and when the doors\\nwere forced, resigned. He demanded \
the keys of the archives; only\\nwhen he brought workmen to force the locks \
were they given up. Then\\nit was discovered that Neratov, former assistant \
Foreign Minister,\\nhad disappeared with the Secret \
Treaties....\\n\\nShliapnikov tried to take possession of the Ministry of \
Labour. It\\nwas bitterly cold, and there was no one to light the fires. Of \
all\\nthe hundreds of employees, not one would show him where the office\\nof \
the Minister was....\\n\\nAlexandra Kollontai, appointed the 13th of November \
Commissar\\nof Public Welfare--the department of charities and \
public\\ninstitutions--was welcomed with a strike of all but forty of \
the\\nfunctionaries in the Ministry. Immediately the poor of the \
great\\ncities, the inmates of institutions, were plunged in miserable \
want:\\ndelegations of starving cripples, of orphans with blue, \
pinched\\nfaces, besieged the building. With tears streaming down her \
face,\\nKollontai arrested the strikers until they should deliver the \
keys\\nof the office and the safe; when she got the keys, however, it \
was\\ndiscovered that the former Minister, Countess Panina, had gone \
off\\nwith all the funds, which she refused to surrender except on \
the\\norder of the Constituent Assembly. (See App. XI, Sect. 4)\\n\\nIn the \
Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Supplies, the\\nMinistry of Finance, \
similar incidents occurred. And the employees,\\nsummoned to return or \
forfeit their positions and their pensions,\\neither stayed away or returned \
to sabotage.... Almost all the\\n_intelligentzia_ being anti-Bolshevik, there \
was nowhere for the\\nSoviet Government to recruit new staffs....\\n\\nThe \
private banks remained stubbornly closed, with a back door open\\nfor \
speculators. When Bolshevik Commissars entered, the clerks left,\\nsecreting \
the books and removing the funds. All the employees of the\\nState Bank \
struck except the clerks in charge of the vaults and the\\nmanufacture of \
money, who refused all demands from Smolny and\\nprivately paid out huge sums \
to the Committee for Salvation and the\\nCity Duma.\\n\\nTwice a Commissar, \
with a company of Red Guards, came formally to\\ninsist upon the delivery of \
large sums for Government expenses. The\\nfirst time, the City Duma members \
and the Menshevik and Socialist\\nRevolutionary leaders were present in \
imposing numbers, and spoke so\\ngravely of the consequences that the \
Commissar was frightened. The\\nsecond time he arrived with a warrant, which \
he proceeded to read\\naloud in due form; but some one called his attention \
to the fact\\nthat it had no date and no seal, and the traditional Russian \
respect\\nfor \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]documents\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] forced \
him again to withdraw....\\n\\nThe officials of the Credit Chancery destroyed \
their books, so that\\nall record of the financial relations of Russia with \
foreign\\ncountries was lost.\\n\\nThe Supply Committees, the administrations \
of the Municipal-owned\\npublic utilities, either did not work at all, or \
sabotaged. And when\\nthe Bolsheviki, compelled by the desperate needs of the \
city\\npopulation, attempted to help or to control the public service, \
all\\nthe employees went on strike immediately, and the Duma flooded\\nRussia \
with telegrams about Bolshevik \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]violation of \
Municipal\\nautonomy.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt Military headquarters, \
and in the offices of the Ministries of\\nWar and Marine, where the old \
officials had consented to work, the\\nArmy Committees and the high command \
blocked the Soviets in every\\nway possible, even to the extent of neglecting \
the troops at the\\nfront. The _Vikzhel_ was hostile, refusing to transport \
Soviet\\ntroops; every troop-train that left Petrograd was taken out \
by\\nforce, and railway officials had to be arrested each \
time--whereupon\\nthe _Vikzhel_ threatened an immediate general strike unless \
they\\nwere released....\\n\\nSmolny was plainly powerless. The newspapers \
said that all the\\nfactories of Petrograd must shut down for lack of fuel in \
three\\nweeks; the _Vikzhel_ announced that trains must cease running \
by\\nDecember first; there was food for three days only in Petrograd, \
and\\nno more coming in; and the Army on the Front was starving.... \
The\\nCommittee for Salvation, the various Central Committees, sent \
word\\nall over the country, exhorting the population to ignore \
the\\nGovernment decrees. And the Allied Embassies were either \
coldly\\nindifferent, or openly hostile....\\n\\nThe opposition newspapers, \
suppressed one day and reappearing next\\nmorning under new names, heaped \
bitter sarcasm on the new regime.\\n(See App. XI, Sect. 5) Even _Novaya \
Zhizn_ characterised it as \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]a\\ncombination of \
demagoguery and impotence.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFrom day to day (it \
said) the Government of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars\\nsinks \
deeper and deeper into the mire of superficial haste. Having\\neasily \
conquered the power... the Bolsheviki can not make use of it.\\n\\nPowerless \
to direct the existing mechanism of Government, they are\\nunable at the same \
time to create a new one which might work easily\\nand freely according to \
the theories of social experimenters.\\n\\nJust a little while ago the \
Bolsheviki hadn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t enough men to run\\ntheir growing party--a \
work above all of speakers and writers; where\\nthen are they going to find \
trained men to execute the diverse and\\ncomplicated functions of government?\
\\n\\nThe new Government acts and threatens, it sprays the country \
with\\ndecrees, each one more radical and more \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]socialist\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] than the last.\\nBut \
in this exhibition of Socialism on Paper--more likely designed\\nfor the \
stupefaction of our descendants--there appears neither the\\ndesire nor the \
capacity to solve the immediate problems of the day!\\n\\nMeanwhile the \
_Vikzhel\[CloseCurlyQuote]s_ Conference to Form a New Government\\ncontinued \
to meet night and day. Both sides had already agreed in\\nprinciple to the \
basis of the Government; the composition of the\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Council was being discussed; the Cabinet was tentatively\\nchosen, with \
Tchernov as Premier; the Bolsheviki were admitted in a\\nlarge minority, but \
Lenin and Trotzky were barred. The Central\\nCommittees of the Menshevik and \
Socialist Revolutionary parties, the\\nExecutive Committee of the Peasant\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Soviets, resolved that,\\nalthough unalterably opposed to \
the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]criminal politics\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of \
the\\nBolsheviki, they would, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in order to halt the \
fratricidal\\nbloodshed,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] not oppose their entrance \
into the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Council.\\n\\nThe flight of Kerensky, \
however, and the astounding success of the\\nSoviets everywhere, altered the \
situation. On the 16th, in a meeting\\nof the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Left \
Socialist Revolutionaries insisted\\nthat the Bolsheviki should form a \
coalition Government with the\\nother Socialist parties; otherwise they would \
withdraw from the\\nMilitary Revolutionary Committee and the _Tsay-ee-kah._ \
Malkin said,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The news from Moscow, where our \
comrades are dying on both sides of\\nthe barricades, determines us to bring \
up once more the question of\\norganisation of power, and it is not only our \
right to do so, but\\nour duty.... We have won the right to sit with the \
Bolsheviki here\\nwithin the walls of Smolny Institute, and to speak from \
this\\ntribune. After the bitter internal party struggle, we shall \
be\\nobliged, if you refuse to compromise, to pass to open \
battle\\noutside.... We must propose to the democracy terms of an \
acceptable\\ncompromise....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAfter a recess to \
consider this ultimatum, the Bolsheviki returned\\nwith a resolution, read by \
Kameniev:\\n\\nThe _Tsay-ee-kah_ considers it necessary that there enter into \
the\\nGovernment representatives of _all the Socialist parties \
composing\\nthe Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies who\\nrecognise \
the conquests of the Revolution of November 7th--that is to\\nsay, the \
establishment of a Government of Soviets, the decrees on\\npeace, land, \
workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] control over industry, and the arming of \
the\\nworking-class._ The _Tsay-ee-kah_ therefore resolves to \
propose\\nnegotiations concerning the constitution of the Government to \
all\\nparties _of the Soviet,_ and insists upon the following conditions\\nas \
a basis:\\n\\nThe Government is responsible to the _Tsay-ee-kah._ \
The\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ shall be enlarged to 150 members. To these \
150\\ndelegates of the Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies shall be\\nadded 75 delegates of the _Provincial_ \
Soviets of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies, 80 from the Front \
organisations of the Army and Navy, 40\\nfrom the Trade Unions (25 from the \
various All-Russian Unions, in\\nproportion to their importance, 10 from the \
_Vikzhel,_ and 5 from\\nthe Post and Telegraph Workers), and 50 delegates \
from the Socialist\\ngroups in the Petrograd City Duma. In the Ministry \
itself, at least\\none-half the portfolios must be reserved to the \
Bolsheviki. The\\nMinistries of Labour, Interior and Foreign Affairs must be \
given to\\nthe Bolsheviki. The command of the garrisons of Petrograd and \
Moscow\\nmust remain in the hands of delegates of the Moscow and \
Petrograd\\nSoviets.\\n\\nThe Government undertakes the systematic arming of \
the workers of\\nall Russia.\\n\\nIt is resolved to insist upon the \
candidature of comrades Lenin and\\nTrotzky.\\n\\nKameniev explained. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The so-called \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Council,\[CloseCurlyQuote]\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]proposed by the \
Conference, would consist of about 420 members, of\\nwhich about 150 would be \
Bolsheviki. Besides, there would be\\ndelegates from the \
counter-revolutionary old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ 100\\nmembers chosen by the \
Municipal Dumas--Kornilovtsi all; 100 delegates\\nfrom the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets--appointed by Avksentiev, and 80 from the\\nold \
Army Committees, who no longer represent the soldier masses.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We refuse to admit the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and also the\
\\nrepresentatives of the Municipal Dumas. The delegates from the\\nPeasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets shall be elected by the Congress of \
Peasants,\\nwhich we have called, and which will at the same time elect a new\
\\nExecutive Committee. The proposal to exclude Lenin and Trotzky is \
a\\nproposal to decapitate our party, and we do not accept it. And\\nfinally, \
we see no necessity for a \[OpenCurlyQuote]People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Council\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] anyway; the\\nSoviets are open to all Socialist parties, \
and the _Tsay-ee-kah_\\nrepresents them in their real proportions among the \
masses....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nKarelin, for the Left Socialist \
Revolutionaries, declared that his\\nparty would vote for the Bolshevik \
resolution, reserving the right\\nto modify certain details, such as the \
representation of the\\npeasants, and demanding that the Ministry of \
Agriculture be reserved\\nfor the Left Socialist Revolutionaries. This was \
agreed to....\\n\\nLater, at a meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Trotzky \
answered a\\nquestion about the formation of the new Government:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know anything about that. I \
am not taking part in the\\nnegotiations.... However, I \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t think that they are of great\\nimportance....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThat night there was great uneasiness in the \
Conference. The\\ndelegates of the City Duma withdrew....\\n\\nBut at Smolny \
itself, in the ranks of the Bolshevik party, a\\nformidable opposition to \
Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s policy was growing. On the night of\\nNovember 17th \
the great hall was packed and ominous for the meeting\\nof the _Tsay-ee-kah._\
\\n\\nLarin, Bolshevik, declared that the moment of elections to \
the\\nConstituent Assembly approached, and it was time to do away with\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]political terrorism.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The measures taken against the freedom of the press \
should be\\nmodified. They had their reason during the struggle, but now they\
\\nhave no further excuse. The press should be free, except for appeals\\nto \
riot and insurrection.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn a storm of hisses and \
hoots from his own party, Larin offered the\\nfollowing resolution:\\n\\nThe \
decree of the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars concerning \
the\\nPress is herewith repealed.\\n\\nMeasures of political repression can \
only be employed subject to\\ndecision of a special tribunal, elected by the \
_Tsay-ee-kah_\\nproportionally to the strength of the different parties \
represented;\\nand this tribunal shall have the right also to reconsider \
measures\\nof repression already taken.\\n\\nThis was met by a thunder of \
applause, not only from the Left\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, but also from a \
part of the Bolsheviki.\\n\\nAvanessov, for the Leninites, hastily proposed \
that the question of\\nthe Press be postponed until after some compromise \
between the\\nSocialist parties had been reached. Overwhelmingly voted \
down.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The revolution which is now being \
accomplished,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] went on Avanessov,\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]has not hesitated to attack private property; and it \
is as private\\nproperty that we must examine the question of the Press....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThereupon he read the official Bolshevik \
resolution:\\n\\nThe suppression of the bourgeois press was dictated not only \
by\\npurely military needs in the course of the insurrection, and for \
the\\nchecking of counter-revolutionary action, but it is also necessary\\nas \
a measure of transition toward the establishment of a new \
r\[EAcute]gime\\nwith regard to the Press--a r\[EAcute]gime under which the \
capitalist owners\\nof printing-presses and of paper cannot be the \
all-powerful and\\nexclusive manufacturers of public opinion.\\n\\nWe must \
further proceed to the confiscation of private printing\\nplants and supplies \
of paper, which should become the property of\\nthe Soviets, both in the \
capital and in the provinces, so that the\\npolitical parties and groups can \
make use of the facilities of\\nprinting in proportion to the actual strength \
of the ideas they\\nrepresent--in other words, proportionally to the number \
of their\\nconstituents.\\n\\nThe re\[EDoubleDot]stablishment of the \
so-called \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]freedom of the \
press,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the simple\\nreturn of printing presses and \
paper to the capitalists,--poisoners\\nof the mind of the people--this would \
be an inadmissible surrender\\nto the will of capital, a giving up of one of \
the most important\\nconquests of the Revolution; in other words, it would be \
a measure\\nof unquestionably counter-revolutionary \
character.\\n\\nProceeding from the above, the _Tsay-ee-kah_ categorically \
rejects\\nall propositions aiming at the re\[EDoubleDot]stablishment of the \
old r\[EAcute]gime in\\nthe domain of the Press, and unequivocally supports \
the point of\\nview of the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars on \
this question, against\\npretentions and ultimatums dictated by petty \
bourgeois prejudices,\\nor by evident surrender to the interests of the \
counter-revolutionary\\nbourgeoisie.\\n\\nThe reading of this resolution was \
interrupted by ironical shouts\\nfrom the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and \
bursts of indignation\\nfrom the insurgent Bolsheviki. Karelin was on his \
feet, protesting.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Three weeks ago the Bolsheviki \
were the most ardent defenders of\\nthe freedom of the Press... The arguments \
in this resolution suggest\\nsingularly the point of view of the old Black \
Hundreds and the\\ncensors of the Tsarist r\[EAcute]gime--for they also \
talked of \[OpenCurlyQuote]poisoners of\\nthe mind of the people.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTrotzky spoke at length in \
favour of the resolution. He\\ndistinguished between the Press during the \
civil war, and the Press\\nafter the victory. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]During \
civil war the right to use violence\\nbelongs only to the oppressed....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Cries of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s the oppressed \
now?\\nCannibal!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]).\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
victory over our adversaries is not yet achieved, and the\\nnewspapers are \
arms in their hands. In these conditions, the closing\\nof the newspapers is \
a legitimate measure of defence....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Then passing\\nto \
the question of the Press after the victory, Trotzky continued:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The attitude of Socialists on the question of freedom \
of the Press\\nshould be the same as their attitude toward the freedom \
of\\nbusiness.... The rule of the democracy which is being established \
in\\nRussia demands that the domination of the Press by private \
property\\nmust be abolished, just as the domination of industry by \
private\\nproperty.... The power of the Soviets should confiscate \
all\\nprinting-plants.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (Cries, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Confiscate the printing-shop of\\n_Pravda!_\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote])\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The monopoly of the \
Press by the bourgeoisie must be abolished.\\nOtherwise it isn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t worth while for us to take the power! Each group\\nof \
citizens should have access to print shops and paper.... The\\nownership of \
print-type and of paper belongs first to the workers\\nand peasants, and only \
afterwards to the bourgeois parties, which\\nare in a minority.... The \
passing of the power into the hands of the\\nSoviets will bring about a \
radical transformation of the essential\\nconditions of existence, and this \
transformation will necessarily be\\nevident in the Press.... If we are going \
to nationalise the banks, can\\nwe then tolerate the financial journals? The \
old r\[EAcute]gime must die;\\nthat must be understood once and for all....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Applause and angry cries.\\n\\nKarelin declared that \
the _Tsay-ee-kah_ had no right to pass upon\\nthis important question, which \
should be left to a special\\ncommittee. Again, passionately, he demanded \
that the Press be free.\\n\\nThen Lenin, calm, unemotional, his forehead \
wrinkled, as he spoke\\nslowly, choosing his words; each sentence falling \
like a\\nhammer-blow. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The civil war is not yet \
finished; the enemy is still\\nwith us; consequently it is impossible to \
abolish the measures of\\nrepression against the Press.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We Bolsheviki have always said that when we reached a \
position of\\npower we would close the bourgeois press. To tolerate the \
bourgeois\\nnewspapers would mean to cease being a Socialist. When one makes \
a\\nRevolution, one cannot mark time; one must always go forward--or \
go\\nback. He who now talks about the \[OpenCurlyQuote]freedom of the Press\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] goes\\nbackward, and halts our headlong course toward \
Socialism.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We have thrown off the yoke of \
capitalism, just as the first\\nrevolution threw off the yoke of Tsarism. _If \
the first revolution\\nhad the right to suppress the Monarchist papers,_ then \
we have the\\nright to suppress the bourgeois press. It is impossible to \
separate\\nthe question of the freedom of the Press from the other questions \
of\\nthe class struggle. We have promised to close these newspapers, and\\nwe \
shall do it. The immense majority of the people is with us!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now that the insurrection is over, we have absolutely \
no desire to\\nsuppress the papers of the other Socialist parties, except \
inasmuch\\nas they appeal to armed insurrection, or to disobedience to \
the\\nSoviet Government. However, we shall not permit them, under \
the\\npretence of freedom of the Socialist press, to obtain, through \
the\\nsecret support of the bourgeoisie, a monopoly of \
printing-presses,\\nink and paper.... These essentials must become the \
property of the\\nSoviet Government, and be apportioned, first of all, to the\
\\nSocialist parties in strict proportion to their voting strength....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen the vote. The resolution of Larin and the \
Left Socialist\\nRevolutionaries was defeated by 31 to 22; the Lenin motion \
was\\ncarried by 34 to 24. Among the minority were the Bolsheviki \
Riazanov\\nand Lozovsky, who declared that it was impossible for them to vote\
\\nagainst any restriction on the freedom of the Press.\\n\\nUpon this the \
Left Socialist Revolutionaries declared they could no\\nlonger be responsible \
for what was being done, and withdrew from the\\nMilitary Revolutionary \
Committee and all other positions of\\nexecutive responsibility.\\n\\nFive \
members--Nogin, Rykov, Miliutin, Teodorovitch and\\nShiapnikov--resigned from \
the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars,\\ndeclaring:\\n\\nWe are \
in favour of a Socialist Government composed of all the\\nparties in the \
Soviets. We consider that only the creation of such a\\nGovernment can \
possibly guarantee the results of the heroic struggle\\nof the working-class \
and the revolutionary army. Outside of that,\\nthere remains only one way: \
the constitution of a purely Bolshevik\\nGovernment by means of political \
terrorism. This last is the road\\ntaken by the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars. We cannot and will not\\nfollow it. We see \
that this leads directly to the elimination from\\npolitical life of many \
proletarian organisations, to the\\nestablishment of an irresponsible r\
\[EAcute]gime, and to the destruction of\\nthe Revolution and the country. We \
cannot take the responsibility\\nfor such a policy, and we renounce before \
the _Tsay-ee-kah_ our\\nfunction as People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars.\\n\\nOther Commissars, without resigning their positions, signed \
the\\ndeclaration--Riazanov, Derbychev of the Press Department, Arbuzov, \
of\\nthe Government Printing-plant, Yureniev, of the Red Guard, \
Feodorov,\\nof the Commissariat of Labour, and Larin, secretary of the \
Section\\nof Elaboration of Decrees.\\n\\nAt the same time Kameniev, Rykov, \
Miliutin, Zinoviev and Nogin\\nresigned from the Central Committee of the \
Bolshevik party, making\\npublic their reasons:\\n\\n... The constitution of \
such a Government (composed of all the parties\\nof the Soviet) is \
indispensable to prevent a new flow of blood, the\\ncoming famine, the \
destruction of the Revolution by the Kaledinists,\\nto assure the convocation \
of the Constituent Assembly at the proper\\ntime, and to apply effectively \
the programme adopted by the Congress\\nof Soviets....\\n\\nWe cannot accept \
the responsibility for the disastrous policy of the\\nCentral Committee, \
carried on against the will of an enormous\\nmajority of the proletariat and \
the soldiers, who are eager to see\\nthe rapid end of the bloodshed between \
the different political\\nparties of the democracy.... We renounce our title \
as members of the\\nCentral Committee, in order to be able to say openly our \
opinion to\\nthe masses of workers and soldiers....\\n\\nWe leave the Central \
Committee at the moment of victory; we cannot\\ncalmly look on while the \
policy of the chiefs of the Central\\nCommittee leads toward the loss of the \
fruits of victory and the\\ncrushing of the proletariat....\\n\\nThe masses \
of the workers, the soldiers of the garrison, stirred\\nrestlessly, sending \
their delegations to Smolny, to the Conference\\nfor Formation of the New \
Government, where the break in the ranks of\\nthe Bolsheviki caused the \
liveliest joy.\\n\\nBut the answer of the Leninites was swift and ruthless. \
Shliapnikov\\nand Teodorovitch submitted to party discipline and returned to \
their\\nposts. Kameniev was stripped of his powers as president of \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ and Sverdlov elected in his place. Zinoviev \
was\\ndeposed as president of the Petrograd Soviet. On the morning of \
the\\n5th, _Pravda_ contained a ferocious proclamation to the people \
of\\nRussia, written by Lenin, which was printed in hundreds of \
thousands\\nof copies, posted on the walls everywhere, and distributed over \
the\\nface of Russia.\\n\\nThe second All-Russian Congress of Soviets gave \
the majority to the\\nBolshevik party. Only a Government formed by this party \
can\\ntherefore be a Soviet Government. And it is known to all that \
the\\nCentral Committee of the Bolshevik party, a few hours before \
the\\nformation of the new Government and before proposing the list of \
its\\nmembers to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, invited to \
its\\nmeeting three of the most eminent members of the Left \
Socialist\\nRevolutionary group, comrades Kamkov, Spiro and Karelin, and \
ASKED\\nTHEM to participate in the new Government. We regret infinitely \
that\\nthe invited comrades refused; we consider their refusal \
inadmissible\\nfor revolutionists and champions of the working-class; we \
are\\nwilling at any time to include the Left Socialist Revolutionaries \
in\\nthe Government; but we declare that, as the party of the majority \
at\\nthe second All-Russian Congress of Soviets, we are entitled and\\nBOUND \
before the people to form a Government....\\n\\n... Comrades! Several members \
of the Central Committee of our party\\nand the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars, Kameniev, Zinoviev, Nogin,\\nRykov, Miliutin \
and a few others left yesterday, November 17th, the\\nCentral Committee of \
our party, and the last three, the Council of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars....\\n\\nThe comrades who left us acted like deserters, because \
they not only\\nabandoned the posts entrusted to them, but also disobeyed the \
direct\\ninstructions of the Central Committee of our party, to the \
effect\\nthat they should await the decisions of the Petrograd and \
Moscow\\nparty organisations before retiring. We blame decisively \
such\\ndesertion. We are firmly convinced that all conscious \
workers,\\nsoldiers and peasants, belonging to our party or sympathising with\
\\nit, will also disapprove of the behaviour of the \
deserters....\\n\\nRemember, comrades, that two of these deserters, Kameniev \
and\\nZinoviev, even before the uprising in Petrograd, appeared \
as\\ndeserters and strike-breakers, by voting at the decisive meeting \
of\\nthe Central Committee, October 23d, 1917, against the \
insurrection;\\nand even AFTER the resolution passed by the Central \
Committee, they\\ncontinued their campaign at a meeting of the party \
workers.... But the\\ngreat impulse of the masses, the great heroism of \
millions of\\nworkers, soldiers and peasants, in Moscow, Petrograd, at the \
front,\\nin the trenches, in the villages, pushed aside the deserters as \
a\\nrailway train scatters saw-dust....\\n\\nShame upon those who are of \
little faith, hesitate, who doubt, who\\nallow themselves to be frightened by \
the bourgeoisie, or who succumb\\nbefore the cries of the latter\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s direct or indirect accomplices!\\nThere is NOT A SHADOW \
of hesitation in the MASSES of Petrograd,\\nMoscow, and the rest of \
Russia....\\n\\n... We shall not submit to any ultimatums from small groups \
of\\nintellectuals which are not followed by the masses, which \
are\\nPRACTICALLY only supported by Kornilovists, Savinkovists, \
_yunkers,_\\nand so forth....\\n\\nThe response from the whole country was \
like a blast of hot storm.\\nThe insurgents never got a chance to \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]say openly their opinion to\\nthe masses of workers \
and soldiers.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Upon the _Tsay-ee-kah_ rolled\\nin like \
breakers the fierce popular condemnation of the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]deserters.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nFor days Smolny \
was thronged with angry delegations and committees,\\nfrom the front, from \
the Volga, from the Petrograd factories. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why\\ndid \
they dare leave the Government? Were they paid by the\\nbourgeoisie to \
destroy the Revolution? They must return and submit\\nto the decisions of the \
Central Committee!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOnly in the Petrograd \
garrison was there still uncertainty. A great\\nsoldier meeting was held on \
November 24th, addressed by\\nrepresentatives of all the political parties. \
By a vast majority\\nLenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s policy was sustained, and the \
Left Socialist Revolutionaries\\nwere told that they must enter the \
government.... _See next page._\\n\\nThe Mensheviki delivered a final \
ultimatum, demanding that all\\nMinisters and _yunkers_ be released, that all \
newspapers be allowed\\nfull freedom, that the Red Guard be disarmed and the \
garrison put\\nunder command of the Duma. To this Smolny answered that all \
the\\nSocialist Ministers and also all but a very few _yunkers_ had \
been\\nalready set free, that all newspapers were free except the \
bourgeois\\npress, and that the Soviet would remain in command of the \
armed\\nforces.... On the 19th the Conference to Form a New \
Government\\ndisbanded, and the opposition one by one slipped away to \
Moghilev,\\nwhere, under the wing of the General Staff, they continued to \
form\\nGovernment after Government, until the end....\\n\\n[Graphic, page \
276: Meeting announcement]\\n\\nAnnouncement, posted on the walls of \
Petrograd, of the result of a\\nmeeting of representatives of the garrison \
regiments, called to\\nconsider the question of forming a new Government. For \
translation\\nsee App. XI, Sect. 6.\\n\\nMeanwhile the Bolsheviki had been \
undermining the power of the\\n_Vikzhel._ An appeal of the Petrograd Soviet \
to all railway workers\\ncalled upon them to force the _Vikzhel_ to surrender \
its powers. On\\nthe 15th, the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ following its procedure toward \
the\\npeasants, called an All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers \
for\\nDecember 1st; the _Vikzhel_ immediately called its own Congress \
for\\ntwo weeks later. On November 16th, the _Vikzhel_ members took \
their\\nseats in the _Tsay-ee-kah._ On the night of December 2d, at \
the\\nopening session of the All-Russian Congress of Railway Workers, \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ formally offered the post of Commissar of Ways \
and\\nCommunications to the _Vikzhel_--which accepted....\\n\\nHaving settled \
the question of power, the Bolsheviki turned their\\nattention to problems of \
practical administration. First of all the\\ncity, the country, the Army must \
be fed. Bands of sailors and Red\\nGuards scoured the warehouses, the railway \
terminals, even the\\nbarges in the canals, unearthing and confiscating \
thousands of\\n_poods_ of food held by private speculators. Emissaries were \
sent\\nto the provinces, where with the assistance of the Land \
Committees\\nthey seized the store-houses of the great grain-dealers. \
Expeditions\\nof sailors, heavily armed, were sent out in groups of five \
thousand,\\nto the South, to Siberia, with roving commissions to capture \
cities\\nstill held by the White Guards, establish order, and _get \
food._\\nPassenger traffic on the Trans-Siberian Railroad was suspended \
for\\ntwo weeks, while thirteen trains, loaded with bolts of cloth and\\nbars \
of iron assembled by the Factory-Shop Committees, were sent out\\neastward, \
each in charge of a Commissar, to barter with the Siberian\\npeasants for \
grain and potatoes....\\n\\nKaledin being in possession of the coal-mines of \
the Don, the fuel\\nquestion became urgent. Smolny shut off all electric \
lights in\\ntheatres, shops and restaurants, cut down the number of street \
cars,\\nand confiscated the private stores of fire-wood held by \
the\\nfuel-dealers.... And when the factories of Petrograd were about \
to\\nclose down for lack of coal, the sailors of the Baltic Fleet \
turned\\nover to the workers two hundred thousand _poods_ from the bunkers of\
\\nbattle-ships....\\n\\nToward the end of November occurred the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wine-pogroms\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (See App. \
XI,\\nSect. 7)--looting of the wine-cellars--beginning with the \
plundering\\nof the Winter Palace vaults. For days there were drunken \
soldiers on\\nthe streets.... In all this was evident the hand of \
the\\ncounter-revolutionists, who distributed among the regiments \
plans\\nshowing the location of the stores of liquor. The Commissars \
of\\nSmolny began by pleading and arguing, which did not stop the \
growing\\ndisorder, followed by pitched battles between soldiers and \
Red\\nGuards.... Finally the Military Revolutionary Committee sent \
out\\ncompanies of sailors with machine-guns, who fired mercilessly \
upon\\nthe rioters, killing many; and by executive order the \
wine-cellars\\nwere invaded by Committees with hatchets, who smashed the \
bottles--or\\nblew them up with dynamite....\\n\\nCompanies of Red Guards, \
disciplined and well-paid, were on duty at\\nthe headquarters of the Ward \
Soviets day and night, replacing the\\nold Militia. In all quarters of the \
city small elective\\nRevolutionary Tribunals were set up by the workers and \
soldiers to\\ndeal with petty crime....\\n\\nThe great hotels, where the \
speculators still did a thriving\\nbusiness, were surrounded by Red Guards, \
and the speculators thrown\\ninto jail. (See App. XI, Sect. 8)...\\n\\nAlert \
and suspicious, the working-class of the city constituted\\nitself a vast spy \
system, through the servants prying into bourgeois\\nhouseholds, and \
reporting all information to the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee, which \
struck with an iron hand, unceasing.\\nIn this way was discovered the \
Monarchist plot led by former\\nDuma-member Purishkevitch and a group of \
nobles and officers, who\\nhad planned an officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
uprising, and had written a letter inviting\\nKaledin to Petrograd. (See App. \
XI, Sect. 9).... In this way was\\nunearthed the conspiracy of the Petrograd \
Cadets, who were sending\\nmoney and recruits to Kaledin....\\n\\nNeratov, \
frightened at the outburst of popular fury provoked by his\\nflight, returned \
and surrendered the Secret Treaties to Trotzky, who\\nbegan their publication \
in _Pravda,_ scandalising the world....\\n\\n[Graphic, page 279: \
Proclamation]\\n\\nBolshevik order. A proclamation of the Committee to Fight \

a decree (See App.\\nXI, Sect. 10) making advertisements a monopoly of the \
official\\nGovernment newspaper. At this all the other papers \
suspended\\npublication as a protest, or disobeyed the law and were \
closed....\\nOnly three weeks later did they finally submit.\\n\\nStill the \
strike of the Ministries went on, still the sabotage of\\nthe old officials, \
the stoppage of normal economic life. Behind\\nSmolny was only the will of \
the vast, unorganised popular masses;\\nand with them the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars dealt, directing\\nrevolutionary mass-action \
against its enemies. In eloquent\\nproclamations, (See App. XI, Sect. 12) \
couched in simple words and\\nspread over Russia, Lenin explained the \
Revolution, urged the people\\nto take the power into their own hands, by \
force to break down the\\nresistance of the propertied classes, by force to \
take over the\\ninstitutions of Government. Revolutionary order. \

loafing!\\n\\n[Graphic, page 281: Appeal to work hard]\\n\\nAppeal of the \

Sect. 13.\\n\\nOn the 20th of November the Military Revolutionary Committee \
issued\\na warning:\\n\\nThe rich classes oppose the power of the \
Soviets--the Government of\\nworkers, soldiers and peasants. Their \
sympathisers halt the work of\\nthe employees of the Government and the Duma, \
incite strikes in the\\nbanks, try to interrupt communication by the \
railways, the post and\\nthe telegraph....\\n\\nWe warn them that they are \
playing with fire. The country and the\\nArmy are threatened with famine. To \
fight against it, the regular\\nfunctioning of all services is indispensable. \
The Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government is \
taking every measure to assure the country\\nand the Army all that is \
necessary. Opposition to these measures is\\na crime against the People. We \
warn the rich classes and their\\nsympathisers that, if they do not cease \
their sabotage and their\\nprovocation in halting the transportation of food, \
they will be the\\nfirst to suffer. They will be deprived of the right of \
receiving\\nfood. All the reserves which they possess will be requisitioned. \
The\\nproperty of the principal criminals will be confiscated.\\n\\nWe have \
done our duty in warning those who play with fire.\\n\\nWe are convinced that \
in case decisive measures become necessary, we\\nshall be solidly supported \
by all workers, soldiers, and peasants.\\n\\nOn the 22d of November the walls \
of the city were placarded with a\\nsheet headed \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]EXTRAORDINARY \
COMMUNICATION\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]:\\n\\nThe Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars has received an urgent telegram\\nfrom the \
Staff of the Northern Front....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There must be no \
further delay; do not let the Army die of hunger;\\nthe armies of the \
Northern Front have not received a crust of bread\\nnow for several days, and \
in two or three days they will not have\\nany more biscuits--which are being \
doled out to them from reserve\\nsupplies until now never touched.... Already \
delegates from all parts\\nof the Front are talking of a necessary removal of \
part of the Army\\nto the rear, foreseeing that in a few days there will be \
headlong\\nflight of the soldiers, dying from hunger, ravaged by the \
three\\nyears\[CloseCurlyQuote] war in the trenches, sick, insufficiently \
clothed,\\nbare-footed, driven mad by superhuman misery.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Military Revolutionary Committee brings \
this to the notice of\\nthe Petrograd garrison and the workers of Petrograd. \
The situation\\nat the Front demands the most urgent and decisive measures. \
...\\nMeanwhile the higher functionaries of the Government \
institutions,\\nbanks, railroads, post and telegraph, are on strike and \
impeding the\\nwork of the Government in supplying the Front with \
provisions.... Each\\nhour of delay may cost the life of thousands of \
soldiers. The\\ncounter-revolutionary functionaries are the most dishonest \
criminals\\ntoward their hungry and dying brethren on the Front....\\n\\nThe \
MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE GIVES THESE CRIMINALS A LAST\\nWARNING. In \
event of the least resistance or opposition on their\\npart, the harshness of \
the measures which will be adopted against\\nthem will correspond to the \
seriousness of their crime....\\n\\n\\nThe masses of workers and soldiers \
responded by a savage tremor of\\nrage, which swept all Russia. In the \
capital the Government and bank\\nemployees got out hundreds of proclamations \
and appeals (See App.\\nXI, Sect. 14), protesting, defending themselves, such \
as this one:\\n\\nTO THE ATTENTION OF ALL CITIZENS.\\n\\nTHE STATE BANK IS \
CLOSED!\\n\\nWHY?\\n\\nBecause the violence exercised by the Bolsheviki \
against the State\\nBank has made it impossible for us to work. The first act \
of the\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars was to DEMAND TEN MILLION \
RUBLES, and on\\nNovember 27th THEY DEMANDED TWENTY-FIVE MILLIONS, without \
any\\nindication as to where this money was to go.\\n\\n... We functionaries \
cannot take part in plundering the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nproperty. We \
stopped work.\\n\\nCITIZENS! The money in the State Bank is yours, the people\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s money,\\nacquired by your labour, your sweat and blood. \
CITIZENS! Save the\\npeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s property from robbery, and us \
from violence, and we shall\\nimmediately resume work.\\n\\nEMPLOYEES OF THE \
STATE BANK.\\n\\nFrom the Ministry of Supplies, the Ministry of Finance, from \
the\\nSpecial Supply Committee, declarations that the \
Military\\nRevolutionary Committee made it impossible for the employees \
to\\nwork, appeals to the population to support them against Smolny.... \
But\\nthe dominant worker and soldier did not believe them; it was \
firmly\\nfixed in the popular mind that the employees were \
sabotaging,\\nstarving the Army, starving the people.... In the long bread \
lines,\\nwhich as formerly stood in the iron winter streets, it was not \
_the\\nGovernment_ which was blamed, as it had been under Kerensky, but \
the\\n_tchinovniki,_ the sabotageurs; for the Government was \
_their_\\nGovernment, _their_ Soviets--and the functionaries of the \
Ministries\\nwere against it....\\n\\nAt the centre of all this opposition \
was the Duma, and its militant\\norgan, the Committee for Salvation, \
protesting against all the\\ndecrees of the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars, voting again and\\nagain not to recognise the \
Soviet Government, openly cooperating\\nwith the new counter-revolutionary \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Governments\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] set up \
at\\nMoghilev.... On the 17th of November, for example, the Committee \
for\\nSalvation addressed \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]all Municipal Governments, \
Zemstvos, and all\\ndemocratic and revolutionary organisations of peasants, \
workers,\\nsoldiers and other citizens,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] in these \
words:\\n\\nDo not recognise the Government of the Bolsheviki, and \
struggle\\nagainst it.\\n\\nForm local Committees for Salvation of Country \
and Revolution, who\\nwill unite all democratic forces, so as to aid the \
All-Russian\\nCommittee for Salvation in the tasks which it has set \
itself....\\n\\nMeanwhile the elections for the Constituent Assembly in \
Petrograd\\n(See App. XI, Sect. 15) gave an enormous plurality to \
the\\nBolsheviki; so that even the Mensheviki Internationalists pointed\\nout \
that the Duma ought to be re-elected, as it no longer\\nrepresented the \
political composition of the Petrograd population....\\nAt the same time \
floods of resolutions from workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] organisations,\\nfrom \
military units, even from the peasants in the surrounding\\ncountry, poured \
in upon the Duma, calling it \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]counter-revolutionary,\\nKornilovitz,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and demanding that it resign. The last days of \
the\\nDuma were stormy with the bitter demands of the Municipal workers\\nfor \
decent living wages, and the threat of strikes....\\n\\nOn the 23d a formal \
decree of the Military Revolutionary Committee\\ndissolved the Committee for \
Salvation. On the 29th, the Council of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars \
ordered the dissolution and re-election of the\\nPetrograd City Duma:\\n\\nIn \
view of the fact that the Central Duma of Petrograd, elected\\nSeptember 2d, \
... has definitely lost the right to represent the\\npopulation of Petrograd, \
being in complete disaccord with its state\\nof mind and its aspirations ... \
and in view of the fact that the\\npersonnel of the Duma majority, although \
having lost all political\\nfollowing, continues to make use of its \
prerogatives to resist in a\\ncounter-revolutionary manner the will of the \
workers, soldiers and\\npeasants, to sabotage and obstruct the normal work of \
the\\nGovernment--the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars \
considers it its duty\\nto invite the population of the capital to pronounce \
judgment on the\\npolicy of the organ of Municipal autonomy.\\n\\nTo this end \
the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars resolves:\\n\\n(1) To \
dissolve the Municipal Duma; the dissolution to take effect\\nNovember 30th, \
1917.\\n\\n(2) All functionaries elected or appointed by the present Duma \
shall\\nremain at their posts and fulfil the duties confided to them, \
until\\ntheir places shall be filled by representatives of the new \
Duma.\\n\\n(3) All Municipal employees shall continue to fulfil their duties;\
\\nthose who leave the service of their own accord shall be \
considered\\ndischarged.\\n\\n(4) The new elections for the Municipal Duma of \
Petrograd are fixed\\nfor December 9th, 1917....\\n\\n(5) The Municipal Duma \
of Petrograd shall meet December 11th, 1917,\\nat two \
o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock.\\n\\n(6) Those who disobey this decree, as well as \
those who\\nintentionally harm or destroy the property of the \
Municipality,\\nshall be immediately arrested and brought before the \
Revolutionary\\nTribunals....\\n\\nThe Duma met defiantly, passing \
resolutions to the effect that it\\nwould \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]defend its \
position to the last drop of its blood,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
and\\nappealing desperately to the population to save their \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]own elected\\nCity Government.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
But the population remained indifferent or\\nhostile. On the 31st Mayor \
Schreider and several members were\\narrested, interrogated, and released. \
That day and the next the Duma\\ncontinued to meet, interrupted frequently by \
Red Guards and sailors,\\nwho politely requested the assembly to disperse. At \
the meeting of\\nDecember 2d, an officer and some sailors entered the Nicolai \
Hall\\nwhile a member was speaking, and ordered the members to leave, \
or\\nforce would be used. They did so, protesting to the last, but\\nfinally \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]ceding to violence.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
new Duma, which was elected ten days later, and for which the\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Moderate\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialists refused to \
vote, was almost entirely\\nBolshevik....\\n\\nThere remained several centres \
of dangerous opposition, such as the\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]republics\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of Ukraine and Finland, which were showing \
definitely\\nanti-Soviet tendencies. Both at Helsingfors and at Kiev \
the\\nGovernments were gathering troops which could be depended upon, \
and\\nentering upon campaigns of crushing Bolshevism, and of disarming \
and\\nexpelling Russian troops. The Ukrainean Rada had taken command of\\nall \
southern Russia, and was furnishing Kaledin reinforcements and\\nsupplies. \
Both Finland and Ukraine were beginning secret\\nnegotiations with the \
Germans, and were promptly recognised by the\\nAllied Governments, which \
loaned them huge sums of money, joining\\nwith the propertied classes to \
create counter-revolutionary centres\\nof attack upon Soviet Russia. In the \
end, when Bolshevism had\\nconquered in both these countries, the defeated \
bourgeoisie called\\nin the Germans to restore them to power....\\n\\nBut the \
most formidable menace to the Soviet Government was internal\\nand \
two-headed--the Kaledin movement, and the Staff at Moghilev,\\nwhere General \
Dukhonin had assumed command.\\n\\n[Graphic, page 287: Education \
Proclamation]\\n\\nProclamation of the Commission of Public Education \

17.\\n\\nThe ubiquitous Muraviov was appointed commander of the war \
against\\nthe Cossacks, and a Red Army was recruited from among the \
factory\\nworkers. Hundreds of propagandists were sent to the Don. The \
Council\\nof People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars issued a proclamation to \
the Cossacks, (See\\nApp. XI, Sect. 16) explaining what the Soviet Government \
was, how\\nthe propertied classes, the _tchin ovniki,_ landlords, bankers and\
\\ntheir allies, the Cossack princes, land-owners and Generals, were\\ntrying \
to destroy the Revolution, and prevent the confiscation of\\ntheir wealth by \
the people.\\n\\nOn November 27th a committee of Cossacks came to Smolny to \
see\\nTrotzky and Lenin. They demanded if it were true that the \
Soviet\\nGovernment did not intend to divide the Cossack lands among \
the\\npeasants of Great Russia? \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered Trotzky. The Cossacks\\ndeliberated for a \
while. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they asked, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]does the Soviet\\nGovernment intend to confiscate the \
estates of our great Cossack\\nland-owners and divide them among the working \
Cossacks?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] To this\\nLenin replied. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]is for _you_ to do. We shall\\nsupport the working \
Cossacks in all their actions.... The best way to\\nbegin is to form Cossacks \
Soviets; you will be given representation\\nin the _Tsay-ee-kah,_ and then it \
will be _your_ Government, too....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Cossacks \
departed, thinking hard. Two weeks later General\\nKaledin received a \
deputation from his troops. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Will you,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they\\nasked, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]promise to \
divide the great estates of the Cossack landlords\\namong the working \
Cossacks?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Only over my \
dead body,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] responded Kaledin. A month later, \
seeing\\nhis army melt away before his eyes, Kaledin blew out his brains. And\
\\nthe Cossack movement was no more....\\n\\nMeanwhile at Moghilev were \
gathered the old _Tsay-ee-kah_ the\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]moderate\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Socialist leaders--from Avksentiev to Tchernov--the \
active\\nchiefs of the old Army Committees, and the reactionary officers. The\
\\nStaff steadily refused to recognise the Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars. It had united about it the Death \
Battalions, the Knights\\nof St. George, and the Cossacks of the Front, and \
was in close and\\nsecret touch with the Allied military attach\[EGrave]s, \
and with the Kaledin\\nmovement and the Ukrainean Rada....\\n\\nThe Allied \
Governments had made no reply to the Peace decree of\\nNovember 8th, in which \
the Congress of Soviets had asked for a\\ngeneral armistice.\\n\\nOn November \
20th Trotzky addressed a note to the Allied Ambassadors:\\n(See App. XI, \
Sect. 18)\\n\\nI have the honour to inform you, Mr. Ambassador, that \
the\\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets... on November 8th constituted a \
new\\nGovernment of the Russian Republic, in the form of the Council \
of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars. The President of this Government \
is Vladimir\\nIlyitch Lenin. The direction of Foreign Affairs has been \
entrusted\\nto me, People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar for Foreign \
Affairs....\\n\\nIn drawing your attention to the text, approved by the \
All-Russian\\nCongress, of the proposition for an armistice and a democratic \
peace\\nwithout annexations or indemnities, based on the right \
of\\nself-determination of peoples, I have the honour to request you \
to\\nconsider that document as a formal proposal of an immediate\\narmistice \
on all fronts, and the opening of immediate peace\\nnegotiations; a proposal \
which the authorised Government of the\\nRussian Republic addresses at the \
same time to all the belligerent\\npeoples and their Governments.\\n\\nPlease \
accept, Mr. Ambassador, the profound assurance of the esteem\\nof the Soviet \
Government toward your people, who cannot but wish for\\npeace, like all the \
other peoples exhausted and drained by this\\nunexampled \
butchery....\\n\\nThe same night the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars telegraphed to\\nGeneral Dukhonin:\\n\\n... The Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars considers it indispensable\\nwithout delay to \
make a formal proposal of armistice to all the\\npowers, both enemy and \
Allied. A declaration conforming to this\\ndecision has been sent by the \

pourparlers with the representatives of the enemy\\narmies.\\n\\n2. Not to \
sign the act of armistice until it has been passed upon by\\nthe Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\\nThe Allied Ambassadors received \
Trotzky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s note with contemptuous\\nsilence, accompanied by \
anonymous interviews in the newspapers, full\\nof spite and ridicule. The \
order to Dukhonin was characterised\\nopenly as an act of treason....\\n\\nAs \
for Dukhonin, he gave no sign. On the night of November 22nd he\\nwas \
communicated with by telephone, and asked if he intended to obey\\nthe order. \
Dukhonin answered that he could not, unless it emanated\\nfrom \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]a Government sustained by the Army and the country.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nBy telegraph he was immediately dismissed from \
the post of Supreme\\nCommander, and Krylenko appointed in his place. \
Following his\\ntactics of appealing to the masses, Lenin sent a radio to all\
\\nregimental, divisional and corps Committees, to all soldiers and\\nsailors \
of the Army and the Fleet, acquainting them with \
Dukhonin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nrefusal, and ordering that \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the regiments on the front shall elect\\ndelegates to \
begin negotiations with the enemy detachments opposite\\ntheir positions....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the 23d, the military attaches of the Allied \
nations, acting on\\ninstructions from their Governments, presented a note to \
Dukhonin,\\nin which he was solemnly warned not to \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]violate the conditions of\\nthe treaties concluded \
between the Powers of the Entente.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The note\\nwent on \
to say that if a separate armistice with Germany were\\nconcluded, that act \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]would result in the most serious consequences\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nto Russia. This communication Dukhonin at once \
sent out to all the\\nsoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees....\\n\\nNext \
morning Trotzky made another appeal to the troops,\\ncharacterising the note \
of the Allied representatives as a flagrant\\ninterference in the internal \
affairs of Russia, and a bald attempt\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to force by \
threats the Russian Army and the Russian people to\\ncontinue the war in \
execution of the treaties concluded by the\\nTsar....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\\n\\nFrom Smolny poured out proclamation after proclamation, (See App.\\nXI, \
Sect. 19) denouncing Dukhonin and the counter-revolutionary\\nofficers about \
him, denouncing the reactionary politicians gathered\\nat Moghilev, rousing, \
from one end of the thousand-mile Front to the\\nother, millions of angry, \
suspicious soldiers. And at the same time\\nKrylenko, accompanied by three \
detachments of fanatical sailors, set\\nout for the _Stavka,_ breathing \
threats of vengeance, (See App. XI,\\nSect. 20) and received by the soldiers \
everywhere with tremendous\\novations--a triumphal progress. The Central Army \
Committee issued a\\ndeclaration in favour of Dukhonin; and at once ten \
thousand troops\\nmoved upon Moghilev....\\n\\nOn December 2d the garrison of \
Moghilev rose and seized the city,\\narresting Dukhonin and the Army \
Committee, and going out with\\nvictorious red banners to meet the new \
Supreme Commander. Krylenko\\nentered Moghilev next morning, to find a \
howling mob gathered about\\nthe railway-car in which Dukhonin had been \
imprisoned. Krylenko made\\na speech in which he implored the soldiers not to \
harm Dukhonin, as\\nhe was to be taken to Petrograd and judged by the \
Revolutionary\\nTribunal. When he had finished, suddenly Dukhonin himself \
appeared\\nat the window, as if to address the throng. But with a savage roar\
\\nthe people rushed the car, and falling upon the old General, dragged\\nhim \
out and beat him to death on the platform....\\n\\nSo ended the revolt of the \
_Stavka_....\\n\\nImmensely strengthened by the collapse of the last \
important\\nstronghold of hostile military power in Russia, the \
Soviet\\nGovernment began with confidence the organisation of the state. Many\
\\nof the old functionaries flocked to its banner, and many members \
of\\nother parties entered the Government service. The \
financially\\nambitious, however, were checked by the decree on Salaries \
of\\nGovernment Employees, fixing the salaries of the \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars--the highest--at five hundred rubles \
(about fifty dollars)\\na month.... The strike of Government Employees, led \
by the Union of\\nUnions, collapsed, deserted by the financial and commercial\
\\ninterests which had been backing it. The bank clerks returned to\\ntheir \
jobs....\\n\\nWith the decree on the Nationalisation of Banks, the formation \
of\\nthe Supreme Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Economy, the putting \
into practical\\noperation of the Land decree in the villages, the democratic\
\\nreorganisation of the Army, and the sweeping changes in all branches\\nof \
the Government and of life,--with all these, effective only by the\\nwill of \
the masses of workers, soldiers and peasants, slowly began,\\nwith many \
mistakes and hitches, the moulding of proletarian Russia.\\n\\nNot by \
compromise with the propertied classes, or with the other\\npolitical \
leaders; not by conciliating the old Government mechanism,\\ndid the \
Bolsheviki conquer the power. Nor by the organized violence\\nof a small \
clique. If the masses all over Russia had not been ready\\nfor insurrection \
it must have failed. The only reason for Bolshevik\\nsuccess lay in their \
accomplishing the vast and simple desires of\\nthe most profound strata of \
the people, calling them to the work of\\ntearing down and destroying the \
old, and afterward, in the smoke of\\nfalling ruins, cooperating with them to \
erect the frame-work of the\\nnew....\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChapter XII\\n\\nThe \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress\\n\\n\\nIt was on November 18th that the \
snow came. In the morning we woke\\nto window-ledges heaped white, and \
snowflakes falling so whirling\\nthick that it was impossible to see ten feet \
ahead. The mud was\\ngone; in a twinkling the gloomy city became white, \
dazzling. The\\n_droshki_ with their padded coachmen turned into sleights, \
bounding\\nalong the uneven street at headlong speed, their drivers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] beards\\nstiff and frozen.... In spite of Revolution, all \
Russia plunging\\ndizzily into the unknown and terrible future, joy swept the \
city\\nwith the coming of the snow. Everybody was smiling; people ran \
into\\nthe streets, holding out their arms to the soft, falling \
flakes,\\nlaughing. Hidden was all the greyness; only the gold and \
coloured\\nspires and cupolas, with heightened barbaric splendour, \
gleamed\\nthrough the white snow.\\n\\nEven the sun came out, pale and \
watery, at noon. The colds and\\nrheumatism of the rainy months vanished. The \
life of the city grew\\ngay, and the very Revolution ran swifter....\\n\\nI \
sat one evening in a _traktir_--a kind of lower-class inn--across\\nthe \
street from the gates of Smolny; a low-ceilinged, loud place\\ncalled \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Uncle Tom\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Cabin,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] much frequented by Red Guards. They\\ncrowded it \
now, packed close around the little tables with their\\ndirty table-cloths \
and enormous china tea-pots, filling the place\\nwith foul cigarette-smoke, \
while the harassed waiters ran about\\ncrying \
_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Seichass! Seichass!_ In a minute! Right away!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn one corner sat a man in the uniform of a \
captain, addressing the\\nassembly, which interrupted him at every few words.\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are no better than murderers!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he cried. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Shooting down \
your\\nRussian brothers on the streets!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When did we do that?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] asked a \
worker.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Last Sunday you did it, when the \
_yunkers_--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well, didn\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they shoot us?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] One man exhibited \
his arm in a sling.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Haven\[CloseCurlyQuote]t I got \
something to remember them by, the devils?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
captain shouted at the top of his voice. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You should \
remain\\nneutral! You should remain neutral! Who are you to destroy the legal\
\\nGovernment? Who is Lenin? A German--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Who are you? A counter-revolutionist! A provocator!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they bellowed\\nat him.\\n\\nWhen he could make \
himself heard the captain stood up. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All right!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nsaid he. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You call \
yourselves the people of Russia. But you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re _not_\\nthe \
people of Russia. The _peasants_ are the people of Russia. Wait\\nuntil the \
peasants--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they cried, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wait until the \
peasants speak. We know what the\\npeasants will say.... Aren\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t they workingmen like \
ourselves?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the long run, everything depended \
upon the peasants. While the\\npeasants had been politically backward, still \
they had their own\\npeculiar ideas, and they constituted more than eighty \
per cent of\\nthe people of Russia. The Bolsheviki had a comparatively \
small\\nfollowing among the peasants; and a permanent dictatorship of \
Russia\\nby the industrial workers was impossible.... The traditional peasant\
\\nparty was the Socialist Revolutionary party; of all the parties \
now\\nsupporting the Soviet Government, the Left Socialist \
Revolutionaries\\nwere the logical inheritors of peasant leadership--and the \
Left\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, who were at the mercy of the \
organised\\ncity proletariat, desperately needed the backing of the \
peasants....\\n\\nMeanwhile Smolny had not neglected the peasants. After the \
Land\\ndecree, one of the first actions of the new _Tsay-ee-kah_ had \
been\\nto call a Congress of Peasants, over the head of the \
Executive\\nCommittee of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets. A few days \
later was issued\\ndetailed Regulations for the _Volost_ (Township) Land \
Committees,\\nfollowed by Lenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Instruction to Peasants,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (See \
App. XII, Sect.\\n1) which explained the Bolshevik revolution and the new \
Government\\nin simple terms; and on November 16th, Lenin and Miliutin \
published\\nthe \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Instructions to Provincial Emissaries,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of whom thousands were\\nsent by the Soviet \
Government into the villages.\\n\\n1. Upon his arrival in the province to \
which he is accredited, the\\nemissary should call a joint meeting of the \
Central Executive\\nCommittees of the Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies, to whom \
he should make a report on the agrarian laws, and\\nthen demand that a joint \
plenary session of the Soviets be summoned....\\n\\n2. He must study the \
aspects of the agrarian problem in the province.\\n\\na. Has the land-owners\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] property been taken over, and if so, in \
what\\ndistricts?\\n\\nb. Who administers the confiscated land--the former \
proprietor, or\\nthe Land Committees?\\n\\nc. What has been done with the \
agricultural machinery and with the\\nfarm-animals?\\n\\n3. Has the ground \
cultivated by the peasants been augmented?\\n\\n4. How much and in what \
respect does the amount of land now under\\ncultivation differ from the \
amount fixed by the Government as an\\naverage minimum?\\n\\n5. The emissary \
must insist that, after the peasants have received\\nthe land, it is \
imperative that they increase the amount of\\ncultivated land as quickly as \
possible, and that they hasten the\\nsending of grain to the cities, as the \
only means of avoiding famine.\\n\\n6. What are the measures projected or put \
into effect for the\\ntransfer of land from the land-owners to the Land \
Committees and\\nsimilar bodies appointed by the Soviets?\\n\\n7. It is \
desirable that agricultural properties well appointed and\\nwell organised \
should be administered by Soviets composed of the\\nregular employees of \
those properties, under the direction of\\ncompetent agricultural scientists.\
\\n\\nAll through the villages a ferment of change was going on, caused\\nnot \
only by the electrifying action of the Land decree, but also by\\nthousands \
of revolutionary-minded peasant-soldiers returning from\\nthe front.... These \
men, especially, welcomed the call to a Congress\\nof Peasants.\\n\\nLike the \
old _Tsay-ee-kah_ in the matter of the second Congress of\\nWorkers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, the Executive \
Committee tried to\\nprevent the Peasant Congress summoned by Smolny. And \
like the old\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ finding its resistance futile, the \
Executive\\nCommittee sent frantic telegrams ordering the election \
of\\nConservative delegates. Word was even spread among the peasants \
that\\nthe Congress would meet at Moghilev, and some delegates went \
there;\\nbut by November 23d about four hundred had gathered in \
Petrograd,\\nand the party caucuses had begun....\\n\\nThe first session took \
place in the Alexander Hall of the Duma\\nbuilding, and the first vote showed \
that more than half of all the\\ndelegates were Left Socialist \
Revolutionaries, while the Bolsheviki\\ncontrolled a bare fifth, the \
conservative Socialist Revolutionaries\\na quarter, and all the rest were \
united only in their opposition to\\nthe old Executive Committee, dominated \
by Avksentiev, Tchaikovsky\\nand Peshekhonov....\\n\\nThe great hall was \
jammed with people and shaken with continual\\nclamour; deep, stubborn \
bitterness divided the delegates into angry\\ngroups. To the right was a \
sprinkling of officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] epaulettes, and\\nthe patriarchal, \
bearded faces of the older, more substantial\\npeasants; in the centre were a \
few peasants, non-commissioned\\nofficers, and some soldiers; and on the left \
almost all the\\ndelegates wore the uniforms of common soldiers. These last \
were the\\nyoung generation, who had been serving in the army.... The \
galleries\\nwere thronged with workers--who, in Russia, still remember \
their\\npeasant origin....\\n\\nUnlike the old _Tsay-ee-kah,_ the Executive \
Committee, in opening\\nthe session, did not recognise the Congress as \
official; the\\nofficial Congress was called for December 13th; amid a \
hurricane of\\napplause and angry cries, the speaker declared that this \
gathering\\nwas merely \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Extraordinary Conference\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]... But the \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Extraordinary\\nConference\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
soon showed its attitude toward the Executive Committee\\nby electing as \
presiding officer Maria Spiridonova, leader of the\\nLeft Socialist \
Revolution aries.\\n\\nMost of the first day was taken up by a violent debate \
as to whether\\nthe representatives of _Volost_ Soviets should be seated, or \
only\\ndelegates from the Provincial bodies; and just as in the Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress, an overwhelming \
majority declared in favour\\nof the widest possible representation. \
Whereupon the old Executive\\nCommittee left the hall....\\n\\nAlmost \
immediately it was evident that most of the delegates were\\nhostile to the \
Government of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars. \
Zinoviev,\\nattempting to speak for the Bolsheviki, was hooted down, and as \
he\\nleft the platform, amid laughter, there were cries, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There\[CloseCurlyQuote]s how a\\nPeople\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar sits in a mudpuddle!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We Left Socialist Revolutionaries refuse,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried Nazariev, a\\ndelegate from the Provinces, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to recognise this so-called \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government until \
the peasants are represented in it.\\nAt present it is nothing but a \
dictatorship of the workers.... We\\ninsist upon the formation of a new \
Government which will represent\\nthe entire democracy!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe reactionary delegates shrewdly fostered \
this feeling, declaring,\\nin the face of protests from the Bolshevik \
benches, that the Council\\nof People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars intended \
either to control the Congress or\\ndissolve it by force of arms--an \
announcement which was received by\\nthe peasants with bursts of \
fury....\\n\\nOn the third day Lenin suddenly mounted the tribune; for ten \
minutes\\nthe room went mad. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Down with him!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they shrieked. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We will \
not\\nlisten to any of your People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars! We don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t recognise \
your\\nGovernment!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nLenin stood there quite \
calmly, gripping the desk with both hands,\\nhis little eyes thoughtfully \
surveying the tumult beneath. Finally,\\nexcept for the right side of the \
hall, the demonstration wore itself\\nout somewhat.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I do not come here as a member of the Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said Lenin, \
and waited again for the noise to subside,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]but as a \
member of the Bolshevik faction, duly elected to this\\nCongress.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] And he held his credentials up to that all might see \
them.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]However,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he went \
on, in an unmoved voice, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]nobody will deny that\\nthe \
present Government of Russia has been formed by the Bolshevik\\nparty--\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he had to wait a moment, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]so \
that for all purposes it is the\\nsame thing....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Here \
the right benches broke into deafening clamour,\\nbut the centre and left \
were curious, and compelled silence.\\n\\nLenin\[CloseCurlyQuote]s argument \
was simple. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Tell me frankly, you peasants, to \
whom\\nwe have given the lands of the _pomieshtchiki;_ do you want now \
to\\nprevent the workers from getting control of industry? This is \
class\\nwar. The _pomieshtchiki_ of course oppose the peasants, and \
the\\nmanufactures oppose the workers. Are you going to allow the ranks \
of\\nthe proletariat to be divided? Which side will you be on?\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We, the Bolsheviki, are the party of the \
proletariat--of the peasant\\nproletariat as well as the industrial \
proletariat. We, the\\nBolsheviki, are the protectors of the Soviets--of the \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSoviets as well as those of the Workers and \
Soldiers. The present\\nGovernment is a Government of Soviets; we have not \
only invited the\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets to join that \
Government, but we have also invited\\nrepresentatives of the Left Socialist \
Revolutionaries to enter the\\nCouncil of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Soviets are the most perfect \
representatives of the people--of\\nthe workers in the factories and mines, \
of the workers in the\\nfields. Anybody who attempts to destroy the Soviets \
is guilty of an\\nanti-democratic and counter-revolutionary act. And I serve \
notice\\nhere on you, comrades _Right_ Socialist Revolutionaries--and on you,\
\\nMessrs. Cadets--that if the Constituent Assembly attempts to destroy\\nthe \
Soviets, we shall not permit the Constituent Assembly to do this\\nthing!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the afternoon of November 25th Tchernov \
arrived in hot haste from\\nMoghilev, summoned by the Executive Committee. \
Only two months\\nbefore considered an extreme revolutionist, and very \
popular with\\nthe peasants, he was now called to check the dangerous drift \
of the\\nCongress toward the Left. Upon his arrival Tchernov was arrested and\
\\ntaken to Smolny, where, after a short conversation, he was \
released.\\n\\nHis first act was to bitterly rebuke the Executive Committee \
for\\nleaving the Congress. They agreed to return, and Tchernov entered\\nthe \
hall, welcomed with great applause by the majority, and the\\nhoots and jeers \
of the Bolsheviki.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! I have been away. I \
participated in the Conference of the\\nTwelfth Army on the question of \
calling a Congress of all the\\nPeasant delegates of the armies of the \
Western Front, and I know\\nvery little about the insurrection which occurred \
here--\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nZinoviev rose in his seat, and shouted, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, you were away--for a\\nfew minutes!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Fearful tumult. Cries, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Down \
with the Bolsheviki!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTchernov continued. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The accusation that I helped lead an army \
on\\nPetrograd has no foundation, and is entirely false. Where does such\\nan \
accusation come from? Show me the \
source!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nZinoviev: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_Izviestia_ and _Dielo Naroda_--your own paper--that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nwhere it comes \
from!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nTchernov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s wide face, \
with the small eyes, waving hair and greyish\\nbeard, became red with wrath, \
but he controlled himself and went on.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I repeat, I \
know practically nothing about what has happened here,\\nand I did not lead \
any army except this army, (he pointed to the\\npeasant delegates), which I \
am largely responsible for bringing\\nhere!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Laughter, \
and shouts of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bravo!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Upon my return I visited Smolny. No such accusation \
was made\\nagainst me there.... After a brief conversation I left--and that\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s all!\\nLet any one present make such an accusation!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAn uproar followed, in which the Bolsheviki and \
some of the Left\\nSocialist Revolutionaries were on their feet all at once, \
shaking\\ntheir fists and yelling, and the rest of the assembly tried to yell\
\\nthem down.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is an outrage, not a session!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] cried Tchernov, and he left the\\nhall; the meeting \
was adjourned because of the noise and disorder....\\n\\nMeanwhile, the \
question of the status of the Executive Committee was\\nagitating all minds. \
By declaring the assembly \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Extraordinary\\nConference,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] it had been planned to block the reelection of \
the\\nExecutive Committee. But this worked both ways; the Left \
Socialist\\nRevolutionists decided that if the Congress had no power over the\
\\nExecutive Committee, then the Executive Committee had no power over\\nthe \
Congress. On November 25th the assembly resolved that the powers\\nof the \
Executive Committee be assumed by the Extraordinary\\nConference, in which \
only members of the Executive who had been\\nelected as delegates might \
vote....\\n\\nThe next day, in spite of the bitter opposition of the \
Bolsheviki,\\nthe resolution was amended to give all the members of the \
Executive\\nCommittee, whether elected as delegates or not, voice and vote in\
\\nthe assembly.\\n\\nOn the 27th occurred the debate on the Land question, \
which revealed\\nthe differences between the agrarian programme of the \
Bolsheviki and\\nthe Left Socialist Revolutionaries.\\n\\nKolchinsky, for the \
Left Socialist Revolutionaries, outlined the\\nhistory of the Land question \
during the Revolution. The first\\nCongress of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Soviets, he said, had voted a precise and\\nformal resolution in favour of \
putting the landed estates\\nimmediately into the hands of the Land \
Committees. But the directors\\nof the Revolution, and the bourgeois in the \
Government, had insisted\\nthat the question could not be solved until the \
Constituent Assembly\\nmet.... The second period of the Revolution, the \
period of\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]compromise,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] was \
signalled by the entrance of Tchernov into the\\nCabinet. The peasants were \
convinced that now the practical solution\\nof the Land question would begin; \
but in spite of the imperative\\ndecision of the first Peasant Congress, the \
reactionaries and\\nconciliators in the Executive Committee had prevented any \
action.\\nThis policy provoked a series of agrarian disorders, which appeared\
\\nas the natural expression of impatience and thwarted energy on the\\npart \
of the peasants. The peasants understood the exact meaning of\\nthe \
Revolution--they tried to turn words into action....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The recent events,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the \
orator, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]do not indicate a simple\\nriot, or a \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Bolshevik adventure,\[CloseCurlyQuote] but on the contrary, \
a real\\npopular rising, which has been greeted with sympathy by the \
whole\\ncountry....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolsheviki in general \
took the correct attitude toward the Land\\nquestion; but in recommending \
that the peasants seize the land by\\nforce, they committed a profound \
error.... From the first days, the\\nBolsheviki declared that the peasants \
should take over the land \[OpenCurlyQuote]by\\nrevolutionary mass action.\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] This is nothing but anarchy; the land can\\nbe taken over \
in an organised manner.... For the Bolsheviki it was\\nimportant that the \
problems of the Revolution should be solved in\\nthe quickest possible \
manner--but the Bolsheviki were not interested\\nin _how_ these problems were \
to be solved....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Land decree of the Congress \
of Soviets is identical in its\\nfundamentals with the decisions of the first \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress. Why\\nthen did not the new Government \
follow the tactics outlined by that\\nCongress? Because the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars wanted to\\nhasten the settlement of the Land \
question, so that the Constituent\\nAssembly would have nothing to \
do....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But also the Government saw that it was \
necessary to adopt\\npractical measures, so without further reflection, it \
adopted the\\nRegulations for Land Committees, thus creating a strange \
situation;\\nfor the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars \
abolished private property in\\nland, but the Regulations drawn up by the \
Land Committees are based\\non private property.... However, no harm has been \
done by that;\\nfor the Land Committees are paying no attention to the Soviet\
\\ndecrees, but are putting into operation their own \
practical\\ndecisions--decisions based on the will of the vast majority of \
the\\npeasants....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]These Land Committees are not \
attempting the legislative solution\\nof the Land question, which belongs to \
the Constituent Assembly\\nalone.... But will the Constituent Assembly desire \
to do the will of\\nthe Russian peasants? Of that we cannot be sure.... All \
we can be sure\\nof is that the revolutionary determination of the peasants \
is now\\naroused, and that the Constituent will be _forced_ to settle \
the\\nLand question the way the peasants want it settled.... The \
Constituent\\nAssembly will not dare to break with the will of the people....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFollowed him Lenin, listened to now with \
absorbing intensity. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At\\nthis moment we are not only \
trying to solve the Land question, but\\nthe question of Social \
Revolution--not only here in Russia, but all\\nover the world. The Land \
question cannot be solved independently of\\nthe other problems of the Social \
Revolution.... For example, the\\nconfiscation of the landed estates will \
provoke the resistance not\\nonly of Russian land-owners, but also of foreign \
capital--with whom\\nthe great landed properties are connected through the \
intermediary\\nof the banks....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The ownership of \
the land in Russia is the basis for immense\\noppression, and the \
confiscation of the land by the peasants is the\\nmost important step of our \
Revolution. But it cannot be separated\\nfrom the other steps, as is clearly \
manifested by the stages through\\nwhich the Revolution has had to pass. The \
first stage was the\\ncrushing of autocracy and the crushing of the power of \
the\\nindustrial capitalists and land-owners, whose interests are \
closely\\nrelated. The second stage was the strengthening of the Soviets \
and\\nthe political compromise with the bourgeoisie. The mistake of \
the\\nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries lies in the fact that at that \
time\\nthey did not oppose the policy of compromise, because they held \
the\\ntheory that the consciousness of the masses was not yet \
fully\\ndeveloped....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]_If Socialism can only be \
realised when the intellectual\\ndevelopment of all the people permits it, \
then we shall not see\\nSocialism for at least five hundred years_.... The \
Socialist political\\nparty--this is the vanguard of the working-class; it \
must not allow\\nitself to be halted by the lack of education of the mass \
average,\\nbut it must lead the masses, using the Soviets as organs \
of\\nrevolutionary initiative.... But in order to lead the wavering, \
the\\ncomrades Left Socialist Revolutionaries themselves must \
stop\\nhesitating....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In July last a series of \
open breaks began between the popular\\nmasses and the \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]compromisers\[CloseCurlyQuote]; but now, in November, the \
Left\\nSocialist Revolutionaries are still holding out their hand \
to\\nAvksentiev, who is pulling the people with his little finger.... \
If\\nCompromise continues, the Revolution disappears. No compromise \
with\\nthe bourgeoisie is possible; its power must be absolutely \
crushed....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We Bolsheviki have not changed our \
Land programme; we have not\\ngiven up the abolition of private property in \
the land, and we do\\nnot intend to do so. We adopted the Regulations for \
Land\\nCommittees,--which are _not_ based on private property at all--because\
\\nwe want to accomplish the popular will in the way the people \
have\\nthemselves decided to do it, so as to draw closer the coalition \
of\\nall the elements who are fighting for the Social Revolution.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We invite the Left Socialist Revolutionaries to enter \
that\\ncoalition, insisting, however, that they cease looking backward, \
and\\nthat they break with the \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]conciliators\[CloseCurlyQuote] of their party....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As far as the Constituent Assembly is concerned, it is \
true, as the\\npreceding speaker has said, that the work of the Constituent \
will\\ndepend on the revolutionary determination of the masses. I say,\\n\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Count on that revolutionary determination, but don\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t forget your\\ngun!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nLenin then read the Bolshevik \
resolution:\\n\\nThe Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress, fully supporting \
the Land decree of November\\n8th... approves of the Provisional Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government\\nof the Russian \
Republic, established by the second All-Russian\\nCongress of Soviets of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\nThe \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress... invites all peasants unanimously to \
sustain\\nthat law, and to apply it immediately themselves; and at the \
same\\ntime invites the peasants to appoint to posts and positions \
of\\nresponsibility only persons who have proved, not by words but by\\nacts, \
their entire devotion to the interests of the exploited\\npeasant-workers, \
their desire and their ability to defend these\\ninterests against all \
resistance on the part of the great\\nland-owners, the capitalists, their \
partisans and accomplices....\\n\\nThe Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress, \
at the same time, expresses its conviction\\nthat the complete realisation of \
all the measures which make up the\\nLand decree can only be successful \
through the triumph of the\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Social Revolution, \
which began November 7th, 1917; for only\\nthe Social Revolution can \
accomplish the definite transfer, without\\npossibility of return, of the \
land to the peasant-workers, the\\nconfiscation of model farms and their \
surrender to the peasant\\ncommunes, the confiscation of agricultural \
machinery belonging to\\nthe great land-owners, the safe-guarding of the \
interests of the\\nagricultural workers by the complete abolition of \
wage-slavery, the\\nregular and methodical distribution among all regions of \
Russia of\\nthe products of agriculture and industry, and the seizure of \
the\\nbanks (without which the possession of land by the whole people\\nwould \
be impossible, after the abolition of private property), and\\nall sorts of \
assistance by the State to the workers....\\n\\nFor these reasons the \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress sustains entirely the\\nRevolution of \
November 7th... as a social revolution, and expresses\\nits unalterable will \
to put into operation, with whatever\\nmodifications are necessary, but \
without any hesitation, the social\\ntransformation of the Russian \
Republic.\\n\\nThe indispensable conditions of the victory of the \
Social\\nRevolution, which alone will secure the lasting success and \
the\\ncomplete realisation of the Land decree, is the close union of \
the\\npeasant-workers with the industrial working-class, with \
the\\nproletariat of all advanced countries. From now on, in the \
Russian\\nRepublic, all the organisation and administration of the State, \
from\\ntop to bottom, must rest on that union. That union, crushing \
all\\nattempts, direct or indirect, open or dissimulated, to return to \
the\\npolicy of conciliation with the bourgeoisie--conciliation, damned \
by\\nexperience, with the chiefs of bourgeois politics--can alone \
insure\\nthe victory of Socialism throughout the world....\\n\\nThe \
reactionaries of the Executive Committee no longer dared openly\\nto appear. \
Tchernov, however, spoke several times, with a modest and\\nwinning \
impartiality. He was invited to sit on the platform.... On the\\nsecond night \
of the Congress an anonymous note was handed up to the\\nchairman, requesting \
that Tchernov be made honorary President.\\nUstinov read the note aloud, and \
immediately Zinoviev was on his\\nfeet, screaming that this was a trick of \
the old Executive Committee\\nto capture the convention; in a moment the hall \
was one bellowing\\nmass of waving arms and angry faces, on both sides.... \
Nevertheless,\\nTchernov remained very popular.\\n\\nIn the stormy debates on \
the Land question and the Lenin resolution,\\nthe Bolsheviki were twice on \
the point of quitting the assembly,\\nboth times restrained by their \
leaders.... It seemed to me as if the\\nCongress were hopelessly \
deadlocked.\\n\\nBut none of us knew that a series of secret conferences were \
already\\ngoing on between the Left Socialist Revolutionaries and \
the\\nBolsheviki at Smolny. At first the Left Socialist Revolutionaries\\nhad \
demanded that there be a Government composed of all the\\nSocialist parties \
in and out of the Soviets, to be responsible to a\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Council, composed of an equal number of delegates from the\\nWorkers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] organisation, and that of \
the Peasants, and\\ncompleted by representatives of the City Dumas and the \
Zemstvos;\\nLenin and Trotzky were to be eliminated, and the \
Military\\nRevolutionary Committee and other repressive organs \
dissolved.\\n\\nWednesday morning, November 28th, after a terrible \
all-night\\nstruggle, an agreement was reached. The _Tsay-ee-kah,_composed of\
\\n108 members, was to be augumented by 108 members elected\\nproportionally \
from the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress; by 100 delegates \
elected\\ndirectly from the Army and the Fleet; and by 50 representatives \
of\\nthe Trade Unions (35 from the general Unions, 10 Railway Workers,\\nand \
5 from the Post and Telegraph Workers). The Dumas and Zemstvos\\nwere \
dropped. Lenin and Trotzky remained in the Government, and the\\nMilitary \
Revolutionary Committee continued to function.\\n\\nThe sessions of the \
Congress had now been removed to the Imperial\\nLaw School building, Fontanka \
6, headquarters of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSoviets. There in the \
great meeting-hall the delegates gathered on\\nWednesday afternoon. The old \
Executive Committee had withdrawn, and\\nwas holding a rump convention of its \
own in another room of the same\\nbuilding, made up of bolting delegates and \
representatives of the\\nArmy Committees.\\n\\nTchernov went from one meeting \
to the other, keeping a watchful eye\\non the proceedings. He knew that an \
agreement with the Bolsheviki\\nwas being discussed, but he did not know that \
it had been concluded.\\n\\nHe spoke to the rump convention. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At present, when everybody is in\\nfavour of forming \
an all-Socialist Government, many people forget\\nthe first Ministry, which \
was _not_ a coalition Government, and in\\nwhich there was only one \
Socialist--Kerensky; a Government which, in\\nits time, was very popular. Now \
people accuse Kerensky; they forget\\nthat he was raised to power, not only \
by the Soviets, but also by\\nthe popular masses....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why did public opinion change toward Kerensky? The \
savages set up\\ngods to which they pray, and which they punish if one of \
their\\nprayers is not answered.... That is what is happening at this \
moment....\\nYesterday Kerensky; to-day Lenin and Trotzky; another \
to-morrow....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We have proposed to both Kerensky \
and the Bolsheviki to retire from\\nthe power. Kerensky has accepted--to-day \
he announced from his\\nhiding-place that he has resigned as Premier; but the \
Bolsheviki\\nwish to retain the power, and they do not know how to use it....\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If the Bolsheviki succeed, or if they fail, the \
fate of Russia will\\nnot be changed. The Russian villages understand \
perfectly what they\\nwant, and they are now carrying out their own \
measures.... The\\nvillages will save us in the end....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn the meanwhile, in the great hall Ustinov had \
announced the\\nagreement between the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress and \
Smolny, received by the\\ndelegates with the wildest joy. Suddenly Tchernov \
appeared, and\\ndemanded the floor.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I understand,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he began, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that an agreement \
is being concluded\\nbetween the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress and \
Smolny. Such an agreement would\\nbe illegal, seeing that the true Congress \
of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets does\\nnot meet until next \
week....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Moreover, I want to warn you now that \
the Bolsheviki will never\\naccept your \
demands....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe was interrupted by a great burst \
of laughter; and realising the\\nsituation, he left the platform and the \
room, taking his popularity\\nwith him....\\n\\nLate in the afternoon of \
Thursday, November 16th, the Congress met\\nin extraordinary session. There \
was a holiday feeling in the air; on\\nevery face was a smile.... The \
remainder of the business before\\nthe assembly was hurried through, and then \
old Nathanson, the\\nwhite-bearded dean of the left wing of the Socialist \
Revolutionaries,\\nhis voice trembling and tears in his eyes, read the report \
of the\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]wedding\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of the \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets with the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nSoviets. At every mention of the word \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]union\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] there was \
ecstatic\\napplause.... At the end Ustinov announced the arrival rival\\nof a \
delegation from Smolny, accompanied by representatives of\\nthe Red Army, \
greeted with a rising ovation. One after another a\\nworkman, a soldier and a \
sailor took the floor, hailing them.\\n\\nThen Boris Reinstein, delegate of \
the American Socialist Labor\\nParty: \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The day of the \
union of the Congress of Peasants and the\\nSoviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies is one of the \
great days\\nof the Revolution. The sound of it will ring with resounding \
echoes\\nthroughout the whole world--in Paris, in London, and across \
the\\nocean--in New York. This union will fill with happiness the hearts \
of\\nall toilers.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A great idea has triumphed. The \
West, and America, expected from\\nRussia, from the Russian proletariat, \
something tremendous.... The\\nproletariat of the world is waiting for the \
Russian Revolution,\\nwaiting for the great things that it is \
accomplishing....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSverdlov, president of the \
_Tsay-ee-kah,_ greeted them. And with the\\nshout, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live the end of civil war! Long live the \
United\\nDemocracy!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] the peasants poured out of the \
building.\\n\\nIt was already dark, and on the ice--covered snow glittered \
the pale\\nlight of moon and star. Along the bank of the canal were drawn up \
in\\nfull marching order the soldiers of the Pavlovsky Regiment, with\\ntheir \
band, which broke into the _Marseillaise._ Amid the crashing\\nfull-throated \
shouts of the soldiers, the peasants formed in line,\\nunfurling the great \
red banner of the Executive Committee of the\\nAll-Russian Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, embroidered newly in gold, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live\\nthe union of the revolutionary and toiling \
masses!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Following were\\nother banners; of the \
District Soviets--of Putilov Factory, which\\nread, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
bow to this flag in order to create the brotherhood of all\\npeople!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nFrom somewhere torches appeared, blazing orange \
in the night, a\\nthousand times reflected in the facets of the ice, \
streaming out\\nsmokily over the throng as it moved down the bank of the \
Fontanka\\nsinging, between crowds that stood in astonished silence.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live the Revolutionary Army! Long live the Red \
Guard! Long\\nlive the Peasants!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSo the great \
procession wound through the city, growing and\\nunfurling ever new red \
banners lettered in gold. Two old peasants,\\nbowed with toil, were walking \
hand in hand, their faces illumined\\nwith child-like bliss.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Well,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said one, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]d like to see them take away our \
land again,\\n_now!_\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nNear Smolny the Red Guard \
was lined up on both sides of the street,\\nwild with delight. The other old \
peasant spoke to his comrade, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am\\nnot tired,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he said. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I walked on air all \
the way!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOn the steps of Smolny about a hundred \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies were \
massed, with their banner, dark against the blaze of\\nlight streaming out \
between the arches. Like a wave they rushed\\ndown, clasping the peasants in \
their arms and kissing them; and the\\nprocession poured in through the great \
door and up the stairs, with\\na noise like thunder....\\n\\nIn the immense \
white meeting-room the _Tsay-ee-kah_ was waiting,\\nwith the whole Petrograd \
Soviet and a thousand spectators beside,\\nwith that solemnity which attends \
great conscious moments in history.\\n\\nZinoviev announced the agreement \
with the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress, to a\\nshaking roar which rose \
and burst into storm as the sound of music\\nblared down the corridor, and \
the head of the procession came in. On\\nthe platform the presidium rose and \
made place for the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\npresidium, the two embracing; \
behind them the two banners were\\nintertwined against the white wall, over \
the empty frame from which\\nthe Tsar\[CloseCurlyQuote]s picture had been \
torn....\\n\\nThen opened the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]triumphal session.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] After a few words of welcome\\nfrom Sverdlov, Maria \
Spiridonova, slight, pale, with spectacles and\\nhair drawn flatly down, and \
the air of a New England school-teacher,\\ntook the tribune--the most loved \
and the most powerful woman in all\\nRussia.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... \
Before the workers of Russia open now horizons which history has\\nnever \
known.... All workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] movements in the past have been \
defeated.\\nBut the present movement is international, and that is why it \
is\\ninvincible. There is no force in the world which can put out the\\nfire \
of the Revolution! The old world crumbles down, the new world\\nbegins....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThen Trotzky, full of fire: \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I wish you welcome, comrades peasants!\\nYou come here \
not as guests, but as masters of this house, which\\nholds the heart of the \
Russian Revolution. The will of millions of\\nworkers is now concentrated in \
this hall.... There is now only one\\nmaster of the Russian land: the union \
of the workers, soldiers and\\npeasants....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nWith \
biting sarcasm he went on to speak of the Allied diplomats,\\ntill then \
contemptuous of Russia\[CloseCurlyQuote]s invitation to an armistice, \
which\\nhad been accepted by the Central \
Powers.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A new humanity will be born of this \
war.... In this hall we swear to\\nworkers of all lands to remain at our \
revolutionary post. If we are\\nbroken, then it will be in defending our \
flag....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nKrylenko followed him, explaining the \
situation at the front, where\\nDukhonin was preparing to resist the Council \
of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let \
Dukhonin and those with him understand well that we shall not\\ndeal gently \
with those who bar the road to peace!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nDybenko \
saluted the assembly in the name of the Fleet, and\\nKrushinsky, member of \
the _Vikzhel,_ said, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]From this moment, when\\nthe \
union of all true Socialists is realised, the whole army of\\nrailway workers \
places itself absolutely at the disposition of the\\nrevolutionary democracy!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] And Lunatcharsky, almost weeping, and\\nProshian, \
for the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, and finally\\nSaharashvili, for the \
United Social Democrats Internationalists,\\ncomposed of members of the \
Martov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and of Gorky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s groups, \
who\\ndeclared:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We left the _Tsay-ee-kah_ because \
of the uncompromising policy of\\nthe Bolsheviki, and to force them to make \
concessions in order to\\nrealise the union of all the revolutionary \
democracy. Now that that\\nunion is brought about, we consider it a sacred \
duty to take our\\nplaces once more in the _Tsay-ee-kah_.... We declare that \
all those\\nwho have withdrawn from the _Tsay-ee-kah_ should now return.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nStachkov, a dignified old peasant of the \
presidium of the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nCongress, bowed to the four \
corners of the room. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I greet you with\\nthe \
christening of a new Russian life and \
freedom!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nGronsky, in the name of the Polish \
Social Democracy; Skripnik, for\\nthe Factory-Shop Committees; Tifonov, for \
the Russian soldiers at\\nSalonika; and others, interminably, speaking out of \
full hearts,\\nwith the happy eloquence of hopes fulfilled....\\n\\nIt was \
late in the night when the following resolution was put and\\npassed \
unanimously:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The _Tsay-ee-kah,_ united in \
extraordinary session with the\\nPetrograd Soviet and the Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Congress, confirms the Land and\\nPeace decrees adopted by \
the second Congress of Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, and also the decree on Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Control\\nadopted by the _Tsay-ee-kah._\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The joint \
session of the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Congress\\nexpresses its firm conviction that the union of workers, \
soldiers\\nand peasants, this fraternal union of all the workers and \
all\\nexploited, will consolidate the power conquered by them, that it\\nwill \
take all revolutionary measures to hasten the passing of the\\npower into the \
hands of the working-class in other countries, and\\nthat it will assure in \
this manner the lasting accomplishment of a\\njust peace and the victory of \
Socialism.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] (See App. XI, Sect. \

in\\nfavour of forcing the Allies to declare democratic war-aims, and \

nIn spite of numerous stories of gigantic advances in wages\\nimmediately \
following the Revolution of March, 1917, these figures,\\nwhich were \
published by the Ministry of Labour as characteristic of\\nconditions all \
over Russia, show that wages did not rise immediately\\nafter the Revolution, \
but little by little. On an average, wages\\nincreased slightly more than 500 \
per cent....\\n\\nBut at the same time the value of the ruble fell to less \
than\\none-third its former purchasing power, and the cost of \
the\\nnecessities of life increased enormously.\\n\\nThe following table was \

nOn an average, the above categories of necessities increased about\\n1,109 \
per cent in price, more than twice the increase of salaries.\\nThe \
difference, of course, went into the pockets of speculators \
and\\nmerchants.\\n\\nIn September, 1917, when I arrived in Petrograd, the \
average daily\\nwage of a skilled industrial worker--for example, a \
steel-worker in\\nthe Putilov Factory--was about 8 rubles. At the same time, \
profits\\nwere enormous.... I was told by one of the owners of the \
Thornton\\nWoollen Mills, an English concern on the outskirts of Petrograd, \
that\\nwhile wages had increased about 300 per cent in his factory, \
his\\nprofits had gone up _900 per cent._\\n\\n3.\\n\\nTHE SOCIALIST \
MINISTERS\\n\\nThe history of the efforts of the Socialists in the \
Provisional\\nGovernment of July to realise their programme in coalition with \
the\\nbourgeois Ministers, is an illuminating example of class struggle \
in\\npolitics. Says Lenin, in explanation of this phenomenon:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The capitalists, ... seeing that the position of the \
Government was\\nuntenable, resorted to a method which since 1848 has been \
for decades\\npractised by the capitalists in order to befog, divide, and \
finally\\noverpower the working-class. This method is the so-called \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Coalition\\nMinistry,\[CloseCurlyQuote] composed of \
bourgeois and of renegades from the Socialist\\ncamp.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In those countries where political freedom and \
democracy have\\nexisted side by side with the revolutionary movement of \
the\\nworkers--for example in England and France--the capitalists make use of\
\\nthis subterfuge, and very successfully too. The \[OpenCurlyQuote]Socialist\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] leaders,\\nupon entering the Ministries, invariably prove \
mere figure-heads,\\npuppets, simply a shield for the capitalists, a tool \
with which to\\ndefraud the workers. The \[OpenCurlyQuote]democratic\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \[OpenCurlyQuote]republican\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
capitalists in\\nRussia set in motion this very same scheme. The \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries and Mensheviki fell victim to it, and on June 1st \
a\\n\[OpenCurlyQuote]Coalition\[CloseCurlyQuote] Ministry, with the \
participation of Tchernov, Tseretelli,\\nSkobeliev, Avksentiev, Savinkov, \
Zarudny and Nikitin became an\\naccomplished \
fact....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--_Problems of the \

nGROWING ARROGANCE OF THE REACTIONARIES\\n\\nSeptember 18th. The Cadet \
Shulgin, writing in a Kiev newspaper, said\\nthat the Provisional Government\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s declaration that Russia was a\\nRepublic constituted a \
gross abuse of its powers. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We cannot admit\\neither a \
Republic, or the present Republican Government.... And we are\\nnot sure that \
we want a Republic in Russia....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOctober 23d. At \
a meeting of the Cadet party held at Riazan, M.\\nDukhonin declared, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]On March 1st we must establish a \
Constitutional\\nMonarchy. We must not reject the legitimate heir to the \
throne,\\nMikhail Alexandrovitch....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nOctober \
27th. Resolution passed by the Conference of Business Men at\\nMoscow:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Conference... insists that the Provisional \
Government take the\\nfollowing immediate measures in the Army:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]1. Forbidding of all political propaganda; the Army \
must be out of\\npolitics.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]2. Propaganda of \
antinational and international ideas and theories\\ndeny the necessity for \
armies, and hurt discipline; it should be\\nforbidden, and all propagandists \
punished....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]3. The function of the Army \
Committees must be limited to economic\\nquestions exclusively. All their \
decisions should be confirmed by\\ntheir superior officers, who have the \
right to dissolve the\\nCommittees at any time....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]4. The salute to be reestablished, and made \
obligatory. Full\\nreestablishment of disciplinary power in the hands of \
officers, with\\nright of review of \
sentence....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]5. Expulsion from the Corps of \
Officers of those who dishonour it by\\nparticipating in the movement of the \
soldier-masses, which teaches\\nthem disobedience.... Reestablishment for \
this purpose of the Courts of\\nHonor....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]6. The \
Provisional Government should take the necessary measures to\\nmake possible \
the return to the army of Generals and other officers\\nunjustly discharged \
under the influence of Committees, and other\\nirresponsible \
organisations....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER \
II\\n\\n1.\\n\\nThe Kornilov revolt is treated in detail in my forthcoming \
volume,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The responsibility of Kerensky for the\\nsituation \
which gave rise to Kornilov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s attempt is now pretty \
clearly\\nestablished. Many apologists for Kerensky say that he knew \
of\\nKornilov\[CloseCurlyQuote]s plans, and by a trick drew him out \
prematurely, and then\\ncrushed him. Even Mr. A. J. Sack, in his book, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Birth of the\\nRussian Democracy,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] says:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Several things... \
are almost certain. The first is that Kerensky knew\\nabout the movement of \
several detachments from the Front toward\\nPetrograd, and it is possible \
that as Prime Minister and Minister of\\nWar, realising the growing \
Bolshevist danger, he called for them....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
only flaw in that argument is that there was no \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Bolshevist\\ndanger\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] at that \
time, the Bolsheviki still being a powerless minority\\nin the Soviets, and \
their leaders in jail or hiding.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nDEMOCRATIC CONFERENCE\\n\\nWhen \
the Democratic Conference was first proposed to Kerensky, he\\nsuggested an \
assembly of all the elements in the nation--\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]the \
live\\nforces,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as he called them--including bankers, \
manufacturers,\\nland-owners, and representatives of the Cadet party. The \
Soviet\\nrefused, and drew up the following table of representation, \
which\\nKerensky agreed to:\\n\\n  \

\\n\\nTHE FUNCTION OF THE SOVIETS IS ENDED\\n\\nOn September 28th, 1917, \
_Izviestia,_ organ of the _Tsay-ee-kah,_\\npublished an article which said, \
speaking of the last Provisional\\nMinistry:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At \
last a truly democratic government, born of the will of all\\nclasses of the \
Russian people, the first rough form of the future\\nliberal parliamentary r\
\[EAcute]gime, has been formed. Ahead of us is the\\nConstituent Assembly, \
which will solve all questions of fundamental\\nlaw, and whose composition \
will be essentially democratic. The\\nfunction of the Soviets is at an end, \
and the time is approaching\\nwhen they must retire, with the rest of the \
revolutionary machinery,\\nfrom the stage of a free and victorious people, \
whose weapons shall\\nhereafter be the peaceful ones of political action.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe leading article of _Izviestia_ for October \
23d was called, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The\\nCrisis in the Soviet \
Organisations.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] It began by saying that\\ntravellers \
reported a lessening activity of local Soviets everywhere.\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is natural,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said the \
writer. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]For the people are becoming\\ninterested in \
the more permanent legislative organs--the Municipal\\nDumas and the \
Zemstvs....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In the important centres of Petrograd \
and Moscow, where the Soviets\\nwere best organised, they did not take in all \
the democratic\\nelements.... The majority of the intellectuals did not \
participate, and\\nmany workers also; some of the workers because they were \
politically\\nbackward, others because the centre of gravity for them was in \
their\\nUnns.... We cannot deny that these organisations are firmly united \
with\\nthe masses, whose everyday needs are better served by them....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That the local democratic administrations are being \
energetically\\norganised is highly important. The City Dumas are elected \
by\\nuniversal suffrage, and in purely local matters have more \
authority\\nthan the Soviets. Not a single democrat will see anything wrong \
in\\nthis....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... Elections to the Municipalities \
are being conduct in a better and\\nmore democratic way than the elections to \
the Soviets... All classes\\nare represented in the Municipalities.... And as \
soon as the local\\nSelf-Governments begin to organise life in the \
Municipalities, the\\nr\[OHat]le of the local Soviets naturally \
ends....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... There are two factors in the falling \
off of interest in the\\nSoviets. The first we may attribute to the lowering \
of political\\ninterest in the masses; the second, to the growing effort \
of\\nprovincial and local governing bodies to organise the building of \
new\\nRussia.... The more the tendency lies in this latter direction, \
the\\nsooner disappears the significance of the Soviets....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We ourselves are being called the \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]undertakers\[CloseCurlyQuote] of our own\\norganisation. In \
reality, we ourselves are the hardest workers in\\nconstructing the new \
Russia....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]When autocracy and the whole \
bureaucratic r\[EAcute]gime fell, we set up the\\nSoviets as a barracks in \
which all the democracy cod find temporary\\nshelter. Now, instead of \
barracks, we are building the permanent\\nedifice of a new system, and \
naturally the people will gradually\\nleave the barracks for more comfortable \
quarters.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTROTZKY\[CloseCurlyQuote]S \
SPEECH AT THE COUNCIL OF THE RUSSIAN REPUBLIC\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
purpose of the Democratic Conference, which was called by \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah,_ was to do away with the irresponsible \
personal\\ngovernment which produced Kornilov, and to establish a responsible\
\\ngovernment which would be capable of finishing the war, and ensure\\nthe \
calling of the Constituent Assembly at the given time. In the\\nmeanwhile \
behind the back of the Democratic Conference, by trickery,\\nby deals between \
Citizen Kerensky, the Cadets, and the leaders of the\\nMenshevik and \
Socialist Revolutionary parties, we received the\\nopposite result from the \
officially announced purpose. A power was\\ncreated around which and in which \
we have open and secret Kornilovs\\nplaying leading parts. The \
irresponsibility of the Government is\\noffically proclaimed, when it is \
announced that the Council of the\\nRussian Republic is to be a \
_consultative_ and not _legislative_\\nbody. In the eighth month of the \
Revolution, the irresponsible\\nGovernment creates a cover for itself in this \
new edition of\\nBieligen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Duma.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The propertied classes have entered this Provision \
Council in a\\nproportion which clearly shows, from elections all over the \
country,\\nthat many of them have no right here whatever. In spite of that \
the\\nCadet party, which until yesterday wanted the Provisional \
Government\\nto be responsible to the State Duma--this same Cadet party \
secured the\\nindependence Assembly the propertied classes will no doubt have \
as\\nfavourable position than they have in this Council, and they will \
not\\nbe able to be irresponsible to the Constituent Assembly.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If the propertied classes were really getting ready \
for the\\nConstituent Assembly six weeks from now, there could be no reason \
for\\nestablishing the irresponsibility of the Government at this time. \
The\\nwhole truth is that the bourgeoisie, which directs the policies \
of\\nthe Provisional Government, has for its aim to break the \
Constituent\\nAssembly. At present this is the main purpose of the propertied\
\\nclasses, which control our entire national policy--external \
and\\ninternal. In the industrial, agrarian and supply departments \
the\\npolitics of the propertied classes, acting with the \
Government,\\nincreases the natural disorganisation caused by the war. \
The\\npropertied classes, which are provoking a peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
revolt! The\\npropertied classes, which are provoking civil war, and openly \
hold\\ntheir course on the bony hand of hunger, with which they intend \
to\\noverthrow the Revolution and finish with the Constituent Assembly!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No less criminal also is the international policy of \
the bourgeoisie\\nand its Government. After forty months of war, the capital \
is\\nthreatened with mortal danger. In reply to this arises a plan to \
move\\nthe Government to Moscow. The idea of abandoning the capital does \
not\\nstir the indignation of the bourgeoisie. Just the opposite. It \
is\\naccepted as a natural part of the general policy designed to \
promote\\ncounter-revolutionary conspiracy. ... Instead of recognising that \
the\\nsalvation of the country lies in concluding peace, instead \
of\\nthrowing openly the idea of immediate peace to all the \
worn-out\\npeoples, over the heads of diplomats and imperialists, and making \
the\\ncontinuation of the war impossible,--the Provisional Government, \
by\\norder of the Cadets, the Counter-Revolutionists and the \
Allied\\nImperialists, without sense, without purpose and without a \
plan,\\ncontinues to drag on the murderous war, sentencing to useless \
death\\nnew hundreds of thousands of soldiers and sailors, and preparing \
to\\ngive up Petrograd, and to wreck the Revolution. At a time \
when\\nBolshevik soldiers and sailors are dying with other soldiers \
and\\nsailors as a result of the mistakes and crimes of others, \
the\\nso-called Supreme Commander (Kerensky) continues to suppress \
the\\nBolshevik press. The leading parties of the Council are acting as \
a\\nvoluntary cover for these policies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We, the \
faction of Social Democrats Bolsheviki, announce that with\\nthis Government \
of Treason to the People we have nothing in common.\\nWe have nothing in \
common with the work of these Murderers of the\\nPeople which goes on behind \
official curtains. We refuse either\\ndirectly or indirectly to cover up one \
day of this work. While\\nWilhelm\[CloseCurlyQuote]s troops are threatening \
Petrograd, the Government of\\nKerensky and Kornilov is preparing to run away \
from Petrograd and\\nturn Moscow into a base of counter-revolution!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We warn the Moscow workers and soldiers to be on their \
guard.\\nLeaving this Council, we appeal to the manhood and wisdom of \
the\\nworkers, peasants and soldiers of all Russia. Petrograd is in \
danger!\\nThe Revolution is in danger! The Government has increased \
the\\ndanger--the ruling classes intensify it. Only the people \
themselves\\ncan save themselves and the \
country.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We appeal to the people. Long live \
immediate, honest, democratic\\npeace! All power to the Soviets! All land to \
the people! Long live\\nthe Constituent \
Assembly!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n5.\\n\\nTHE \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]NAKAZ\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] TO SKOBELIEV\\n\\n_Resum\
\[EAcute]_\\n\\n(Passed by the _Tsay-ee-kah_ and given to Skobeliev as an \
instruction\\nfor the representative of the Russian Revolutionary democracy \
at the\\nParis Conference.)\\n\\nThe peace treaty must be based on the \
principle, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No annexations, no\\nindemnities, the right \
of self-determination of peoples.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n_Territorial \
Problems_\\n\\n(1) Evacuation of German troops from invaded Russia. Full \
right of\\nself-determination to Poland, Lithuania and Livonia.\\n\\n(2) For \
Turkish Armenia autonomy, and later complete\\nself-determination, as soon as \
local Governments are established.\\n\\n(3) The question of Alsace-Lorraine \
to be solved by a plebiscite,\\nafter the withdrawal of all foreign \
troops.\\n\\n(4) Belgium to be restored. Compensation for damages from \
an\\ninternational fund.\\n\\n(5) Serbia and Montenegro to be restored, and \
aided by an\\ninternational relief fund. Serbia to have an outlet on the \
Adriatic.\\nBosnia and Herzegovina to be autonomous.\\n\\n(6) The disputed \
provinces in the Balkans to have provisional\\nautonomy, followed by a \
plebiscite.\\n\\n(7) Rumania to be restored, but forced to give \
complete\\nself-determination to the Dobrudja.... Rumania must be forced \
to\\nexecute the clauses of the Berlin Treaty concerning the Jews, \
and\\nrecognise them as Rumanian citizens.\\n\\n(8) In Italia Irridenta a \
provisional autonomy, followed by a\\nplebiscite to determine state \
dependence.\\n\\n(9) The German colonies to be returned.\\n\\n(10) Greece and \
Persia to be restored.\\n\\n_Freedom of the Seas_\\n\\nAll straits opening \
into inland seas, as well as the Suez and Panama\\nCanals, are to be \
neutralised. Commercial shipping to be free. The\\nright of privateering to \
be abolished. The torpedoing of commercial\\nships to be \
forbidden.\\n\\n_Indemnities_\\n\\nAll combatants to renounce demands for any \
indemnities, either direct\\nor indirect--as, for instance, charges for the \
maintenance of\\nprisoners. Indemnities and contributions collected during \
the war\\nmust be refunded.\\n\\n_Economic Terms_\\n\\nCommercial treaties \
are not to be a part of the peace terms. Every\\ncountry must be independent \
in its commercial relations, and must not\\nbe obliged to, or prevented from, \
concluding an economic treaty, by\\nthe Treaty of Peace. Nevertheless, all \
nations should bind\\nthemselves, by the Peace Treaty, not to practise an \
economic blockade\\nafter the war, nor to form separate tariff agreements. \
The right of\\nmost favoured nation must be given to all countries \
without\\ndistinction.\\n\\n_Guarantees of Peace_\\n\\nPeace is to be \
concluded at the Peace Conference by delegates elected\\nby the national \
representative institutions of each country. The\\npeace terms are to be \
confirmed by these parliaments.\\n\\nSecret diplomacy is to be abolished; all \
parties are to bind\\nthemselves not to conclude any secret treaties. Such \
treaties are\\ndeclared in contradiction to international law, and void. \
All\\ntreaties, until confirmed by the parliaments of the \
different\\nnations, are to be considered void.\\n\\nGradual disarmament both \
on land and sea, and the establishment of a\\nmilitia system. The \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]League of Nations\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] advanced by \
President Wilson\\nmay become a valuable aid to international law, provided \
that (a),\\nall nations are to be obliged to participate in it with equal \
rights,\\nand (b), international politics are to be democratised.\\n\\n_Ways \
to Peace_\\n\\nThe Allies are to announce immediately that they are willing \
to open\\npeace negotiations as soon as the enemy powers declare their \
consent\\nto the renunciation of all forcible annexations.\\n\\nThe Allies \
must bind themselves not to begin any peace negotiations,\\nnor to conclude \
peace, except in a general Peace Conference with the\\nparticipation of \
delegates from all the neutral countries.\\n\\nAll obstacles to the Stockholm \
Socialist Conference are to be\\nremoved, and passports are to be given \
immediately to all delegates\\nof parties and organisations who wish to \

Ribot revelations of Austria\[CloseCurlyQuote]s peace-offer to France; \
the\\nso-called \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Peace Conference\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] at Berne, Switzerland, during the summer\\nof 1917, \
in which delegates participated from all belligerent\\ncountries, \
representing large financial interests in all these\\ncountries; and the \
attempted negotiations of an English agent with a\\nBulgarian church \
dignitary; all pointed to the fact that there were\\nstrong currents, on both \
sides, favourable to patching up a peace at\\nthe expense of Russia. In my \
next book, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov to Brest-Litovsk,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\nI intend to treat this matter at some length, \
publishing several\\nsecret documents discovered in the Ministry of Foreign \
Affairs at\\nPetrograd.\\n\\n7.\\n\\nRUSSIAN SOLDIERS IN \
FRANCE\\n\\n_Official Report of the Provisional Government._\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]From the time the news of the Russian Revolution \
reached Paris,\\nRussian newspapers of extreme tendencies immediately began \
to appear;\\nand these newspapers, as well as individuals, freely circulated \
among\\nthe soldier masses and began a Bolshevik propaganda, often \
spreading\\nfalse news which appeared in the French journals. In the absence \
of\\nall official news, and of precise details, this campaign \
provoked\\ndiscontent among the soldiers. The result was a desire to return \
to\\nRussia, and a hatred toward the \
officers.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Finally it all turned into rebellion. \
In one of their meetings, the\\nsoldiers issued an appeal to refuse to drill, \
since they had decided\\nto fight no more. It was decided to isolate the \
rebels, and General\\nZankievitch ordered all soldiers loyal to the \
Provisional Government\\nto leave the camp of Courtine, and to carry with \
them all ammunition.\\nOn June 25th the order was executed; there remained at \
the camp only\\nthe soldiers who said they would submit \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]conditionally\[CloseCurlyQuote] to the\\nProvisional \
Government. The soldiers at the camp of Courtine received\\nseveral times the \
visit of the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian\\nArmies abroad, of Rapp, the \
Commissar of the Ministry of War, and of\\nseveral distinguished former \
exiles who wished to influence them, but\\nthese attempts were unsuccessful, \
and finally Commissar Rapp insisted\\nthat the rebels lay down their arms, \
and, in sign of submission,\\nmarch in good order to a place called \
Clairvaux. The order was only\\npartially obeyed; first 500 men went out, of \
whom 22 were arrested;\\n24 hours later about 6,000 followed.... About 2,000 \
remained....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It was decided to increase the \
pressure; their rations were\\ndiminished, their pay was cut off, and the \
roads toward the village\\nof Courtine were guarded by French soldiers. \
General Zankievitch,\\nhaving discovered that a Russian artillery brigade was \
passing\\nthrough France, decided to form a mixed detachment of infantry \
and\\nartillery to reduce the rebels. A deputation was sent to the \
rebels;\\nthe deputation returned several hours later, convinced of \
the\\nfutility of the negotiations. On September 1st General \
Zankievitch\\nsent an ultimatum to the rebels demanding that they lay down \
their\\narms, and menacing in case of refusal to open fire with artillery \
if\\nthe order was not obeyed by September 3d at 10 o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock.\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The order not being executed, a light fire of \
artillery was opened\\non the place at the hour agreed upon. Eighteen shells \
were fired, and\\nthe rebels were warned that the bombardment would become \
more\\nintense. In the night of September 3d 160 men surrendered. \
September\\n4th the artillery bombardment recommenced, and at 11 o\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock, after\\n36 shells had been fired, the rebels raised \
two white flags and began\\nto leave the camp without arms. By evening 8,300 \
men had surrendered.\\n150 soldiers who remained in the camp opened fire with \
machine-guns\\nthat night. The 5th of September, to make an end of the \
affair, a\\nheavy barrage was laid on the camp, and our soldiers occupied \
it\\nlittle by little. The rebels kept up a heavy fire with \
their\\nmachine-guns. September 6th, at 9 o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock, the camp \
was entirely\\noccupied.... After the disarmament of the rebels, 81 arrests \
were\\nmade....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThus the report. From secret \
documents discovered in the Ministry of\\nForeign Affairs, however, we know \
that the account is not strictly\\naccurate. The first trouble arose when the \
soldiers tried to form\\nCommittees, as their comrades in Russia were doing. \
They demanded to\\nbe sent back to Russia, which was refused; and then, being \
considered\\na dangerous influence in France, they were ordered to Salonika. \
They\\nrefused to go, and the battle followed.... It was discovered that they\
\\nhad been left in camp without officers for about two months, and\\nbadly \
treated, before they became rebellious. All attempts to find\\nout the name \
of the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russian artillery brigade\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] which had fired on\\nthem were futile; the telegrams \
discovered in the Ministry left it to\\nbe inferred that French artillery was \
used....\\n\\nAfter their surrender, more than two hundred of the mutineers \
were\\nshot in cold blood.\\n\\n8.\\n\\nTERESTCHENKO\[CloseCurlyQuote]S \
SPEECH_ (Resum\[EAcute]_)\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... The questions of \
foreign policy are closely related to those of\\nnational defence.... And so, \
if in questions of national defence you\\nthink it is necessary to hold \
session in secret, also in our foreign\\npolicy we are sometimes forced to \
observe the same secrecy....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]German diplomacy \
attempts to influence public opinion.... Therefore\\nthe declarations of \
directors of great democratic organisations who\\ntalk loudly of a \
revolutionary Congress, and the impossibility of\\nanother winter campaign, \
are dangerous.... All these declarations cost\\nhuman lives....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I wish to speak merely of governmental logic, without \
touching the\\nquestions of the honour and dignity of the State. From the \
point of\\nview of logic, the foreign policy of Russia ought to be based on a\
\\nreal comprehension of the _interests_ of Russia.... These interests\\nmean \
that it is impossible that our country remain alone, and that\\nthe present \
alignment of forces with us, (the Allies), is\\nsatisfactory.... All humanity \
longs for peace, but in Russia no one\\nwill permit a humiliating peace which \
would violate the State\\ninterests of our \
fatherland!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe orator pointed out that such a \
peace would for long years, if not\\nfor centuries, retard the triumph of \
democratic principles in the\\nworld, and would inevitably cause new wars.\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All remember the days of May, when the \
fraternisation on our Front\\nthreatened to end the war by a simple cessation \
of military\\noperations, and lead the country to a shameful separate \
peace... and\\nwhat efforts it was necessary to use to make the soldier \
masses at\\nthe front understand that it was not by this method that the \
Russian\\nState must end the war and guarantee its interest....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe spoke of the miraculous effect of the July \
offensive, what\\nstrength it gave to the words of Russian ambassadors \
abroad, and the\\ndespair in Germany caused by the Russian victories. And \
also, the\\ndisillusionment in Allied countries which followed the \
Russian\\ndefeat....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As to the Russian \
Government, it adhered strictly to the formula of\\nMay, \[OpenCurlyQuote]No \
annexations and no punitive indemnities.\[CloseCurlyQuote] We consider \
it\\nessential not only to proclaim the self-determination of peoples, \
but\\nalso to renounce imperialist \
aims....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nGermany is continually trying to make \
peace. The only talk in Germany\\nis of peace; she knows she cannot \
win.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I reject the reproaches aimed at the \
Government which allege that\\nRussian foreign policy does not speak clearly \
enough about the aims\\nof the war....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]If the \
question arises as to what ends the Allies are pursuing, it\\nis \
indispensable first to demand what aims the Central Powers have\\nagreed \
upon....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The desire is often heard that we \
publish the details of the\\ntreaties which bind the Allies; but people \
forget that, up to now, we\\ndo not know the treaties which bind the Central \
Powers....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nGermany, he said, evidently wants to \
separate Russia from the West by\\na series of weak buffer-states.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This tendency to strike at the vital interests of \
Russia must be\\nchecked....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And will the Russian \
democracy, which has inscribed on its banner\\nthe rights of nations to \
dispose of themselves, allow calmly the\\ncontinuation of oppression upon the \
most civilised peoples \
(in\\nAustria-Hungary)?\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Those who fear that the \
Allies will try to profit by our difficult\\nsituation, to make us support \
more than our share of the burden of\\nwar, and to solve the questions of \
peace at our expense, are entirely\\nmistaken.... Our enemy looks upon Russia \
as a market for its products.\\nThe end of the war will leave us in a feeble \
condition, and with our\\nfrontier open the flood of German products can \
easily hold back for\\nyears our industrial development. Measures must be \
taken to guard\\nagainst this....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I say openly \
and frankly: the combination of forces which unites us\\nto the Allies is \
_favourable to the interests of Russia...._ It is\\ntherefore important that \
our views on the questions of war and peace\\nshall be in accord with the \
views of the Allies as clearly and\\nprecisely as possible.... To avoid all \
misunderstanding, I must say\\nfrankly that Russia must present at the Paris \
Conference _one point\\nof view...._\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe did not \
want to comment on the _nakaz_ to Skobeliev, but he\\nreferred to the \
Manifesto of the Dutch-Scandinavian Committee, just\\npublished in Stockholm. \
This Manifesto declared for the autonomy of\\nLithuania and Livonia; \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]but that is clearly \
impossible,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said\\nTerestchenko, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]for Russia must have free ports on the Baltic all \
the\\nyear round....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In this question the \
problems of foreign policy are also closely\\nrelated to interior politics, \
for if there existed a strong sentiment\\nof unity of all great Russia, one \
would not witness the repeated\\nmanifestations, everywhere, of a desire of \
peoples to separate from\\nthe Central Government.... Such separations are \
contrary to the\\ninterests of Russia, and the Russian delegates cannot raise \
the\\nissue....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n9.\\n\\nTHE BRITISH FLEET \
(_etc._)\\n\\nAt the time of the naval battle of the Gulf of Riga, not only \
the\\nBolsheviki, but also the Ministers of the Provisional \
Government,\\nconsidered that the British Fleet had deliberately abandoned \
the\\nBaltic, as one indication of the attitude so often expressed \
publicly\\nby the British press, and semi-publicly by British representatives \
in\\nRussia, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russia\[CloseCurlyQuote]s finished! No \
use bothering about Russia!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nSee interview with \
Kerensky (Appendix 13).\\n\\nGENERAL GURKO was a former Chief of Staff of the \
Russian armies under\\nthe Tsar. He was a prominent figure in the corrupt \
Imperial Court.\\nAfter the Revolution, he was one of the very few persons \
exiled for\\nhis political and personal record. The Russian naval defeat in \
the\\nGulf of Riga coincided with the public reception, by King George \
in\\nLondon, of General Gurko, a man whom the Russian \
Provisional\\nGovernment considered dangerously pro-German as well as \
reactionary!\\n\\n10.\\n\\nAPPEALS AGAINST INSURRECTION\\n\\n_To Workers and \
Soldiers_\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! The Dark Forces are \
increasingly trying to call forth in\\nPetrograd and other towns DISORDERS \
AND _Pogroms._ Disorder is\\nnecessary to the Dark Forces, for disorder will \
give them an\\nopportunity for crushing the revolutionary movement in blood. \
Under\\nthe pretext of establishing order, and of protecting the inhabitants,\
\\nthey hope to establish the domination of Kornilov, which \
the\\nrevolutionary people succeeded in suppressing not long ago.\\nWoe to \
the people if these hopes are realised! The triumphant\\ncounter-revolution \
will destroy the Soviets and the Army Committees,\\nwill disperse the \
Constituent Assembly, will stop the transfer of the\\nland to the Land \
Committees, will put an end to all the hopes of the\\npeople for a speedy \
peace, and will fill all the prisons with\\nrevolutionary soldiers and \
workers.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In their calculations, the \
counter-revolutionists and Black Hundred\\nleaders are counting on the \
serious discontent of the unenlightened\\npart of the people with the \
disorganisation of the food-supply, the\\ncontinuation of the war, and the \
general difficulties of life. They\\nhope to transform every demonstration of \
soldiers and workers into a\\n_pogrom,_ which will frighten the peaceful \
population and throw it\\ninto the arms of the Restorers of Law and Order.\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Under such conditions every attempt to organise a \
demonstration in\\nthese days, although for the most laudable object, would \
be a crime.\\nAll conscious workers and soldiers who are displeased with the \
policy\\nof the Government will only bring injury to themselves and to \
the\\nRevolution if they indulge in demonstrations.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]THEREFORE THE _Tsay-ee-kah_ ASKS ALL WORKERS NOT TO \

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our country is in danger. On account of this danger \
our freedom and\\nour Revolution are passing through difficult days. The \
enemy is at\\nthe gates of Petrograd. The disorganisation is growing with \
every\\nhours. It becomes more and more difficult to obtain bread \
for\\nPetrograd. All, of from the smallest to the greatest, must \
redouble\\ntheir efforts, must endeavour to arrange things properly.... We \
must\\nsave our country, save freedom.... More arms and provisions for \
the\\nArmy! Bread--for the great cities. Order and organisation in \
the\\ncountry....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And in these terrible critical \
days rumours creep about that\\nSOMEWHERE a demonstration is being prepared, \
that SOME ONE is calling\\non the soldiers and workers to destroy \
revolutionary peace and\\norder.... _Rabotchi Put,_ the newspaper of the \
Bolsheviki, is pouring\\noil on the flames: it flattering, trying to please \
the unenlightened\\npeople, tempting the worker and soldiers, urging them on \
against the\\nGovernment, promising them mountains of good things.... The \
confiding,\\nignorant men believe, they do not reason.... And from the other \
side\\ncome also rumours--rumours that the Dark Forces, the friends of \
the\\nTsar, the German spies, are rubbing their hands with glee. They \
are\\nready to join the Bolsheviki, and with them fan the disorders \
into\\ncivil war.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolsheviki and the ignorant \
soldiers and workers seduced by them\\ncry senselessly: \[OpenCurlyQuote]Down \
with the Government! All power to the\\nSoviets!\[CloseCurlyQuote] And the \
Dark servants of the Tsar and the spies of Wilhelm\\nwill egg the on; \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Beat the Jews, beat the shopkeepers, rob the\\nmarkets, \
devastate the shops, pillage the wine stores! Slay, burn,\\nrob!\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And then will begin a terrible \
confusion, a war between one part of\\nthe people and the other. All will \
become still more disorganised,\\nand perhaps once more blood will be shed on \
the streets of the\\ncapital. And then what \
then?\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Then, the road to Petrograd will be open to \
Wilhelm. Then, no bread\\nwill come to Petrograd, the children will die of \
hunger. Then, the\\nArmy as the front will remain without support, our \
brothers in the\\ntrenches will be delivered to the fire of the enemy. Then, \
Russia\\nwill lose all prestige in other countries, our money will lose \
its\\nvalue; everything will be so dear as to make life impossible. \

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]LETTER TO THE \
COMRADES\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThis series of articles appeared in \
_Rabotchi Put_ several days\\nrunning, at the end of October and beginning of \
November, 1917. I\\ngive here only extracts from two instalments:\\n\\n1. \
Kameniev and Riazanov say that we have not a majority among the\\npeople, and \
that without a majority insurrection is \
hopeless.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Answer: People capable of speaking such \
things are falsifiers,\\npedants, or simply don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to \
look the real situation in the face.\\nIn the last elections we received in \
all the country more than fifty\\nper cent of all thevotes....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The most important thing in Russia to-day is the \
peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nrevolution. In Tambov Government there has been \
a real agrarian\\nuprising with wonderful political results.... Even _Dielo \
Naroda_ has\\nbeen scared into yelling that the land must be turned over to \
the\\npeasants, and not only the Socialist Revolutionaries in the \
Council\\nof the Republic, but also the Government itself, has been similarly\
\\naffected. Another valuable result was the bringing of bread which \
had\\nbeen hoarded by the _pomieshtchiki_ to the railroad stations in \
that\\nprovince. The _Russkaya Volia_ had to admit that the stations \
were\\nfilled with bread after the peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
rising....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]2. We are not sufficiently strong to \
take over the Government, and\\nthe bourgeoisie is not sufficiently strong to \
prevent the Constituent\\nAssembly.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Answer: This \
is nothing but timidity, expressed by pessimism as\\nregards workers and \
soldiers, and optimism as regards the failure of\\nthe bourgeoisie. If \
_yunkers_ and Cossacks say they will fight, you\\nbelieve them; if workmen \
and soldiers say so, you doubt it. What is\\nthe distinction between such \
doubts and siding politically with the\\nbourgeoisie?\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov proved that the Soviets were really a power. \
To believe\\nKerensky and the Council of the Republic, if the bourgeoisie is \
not\\nstrong enough to break the Soviets, it is not strong enough to \
break\\nthe Constituent. But that is wrong. The bourgeoisie will break \
the\\nConstituent by sabotage, by lock-outs, by giving up Petrograd, \
by\\nopening the front to the Germans. This has already been done in \
the\\ncase of Riga....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]3. The Soviets must remain \
a revolver at the head of the Government\\nto force the calling of the \
Constituent Assembly, and to suppress any\\nfurther Kornilov attempts.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Answer: Refusal of insurrection is refusal of \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]All Power to the\\nSoviets.\[CloseCurlyQuote] Since \
September the Bolshevik party has been discussing the\\nquestion of \
insurrection. Refusing to rise means to trust our hopes\\nin the faith of the \
good bourgeoisie, who have \[OpenCurlyQuote]promised\[CloseCurlyQuote] to \
call the\\nConstituent Assembly. When the Soviets have all the power, \
the\\ncalling of the Constituent is guaranteed, and its success \
assured.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Refusal of insurrection means surrender \
to the \[OpenCurlyQuote]Lieber-Dans.\[CloseCurlyQuote] Either\\nwe must drop \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]All Power to the Soviets\[CloseCurlyQuote] or make an \
insurrection;\\nthere is no middle course.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]4. The bourgeoisie cannot give up Petrograd, although \
the Rodziankos\\nwant it, because it is not the bourgeoisie who are fighting, \
but our\\nheroic soldiers and sailors.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Answer: \
This did not prevent two admirals from running away at the\\nMoonsund battle. \
The Staff has not changed; it is composed of\\nKornilovtsi. If the Staff, \
with Kerensky at its head, wants to give\\nup Petrograd, it can do it doubly \
or trebly. It can make arrangements\\nwith the Germans or the British; open \
the fronts. It can sabotage the\\nArmy\[CloseCurlyQuote]s food supply. At all \
these doors has it knocked.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We have no right to \
wait until the bourgeoisie chokes the\\nRevolution. Rodzianko is a man of \
action, who has faithfully and\\ntruthfully served the bourgeoisie for \
years.... Half the Lieber-Dans\\nare cowardly compromisers; half of them \
simple fatalists....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]5. \
We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re getting stronger every day. We shall be able to enter \
the\\nConstituent Assembly as a strong opposition. Then why should we \
play\\neverything on one card?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Answer: This is the argument of a sophomore with no \
practical\\nexperience, who reads that the Constituent Assembly is being \
called\\nand trustfully accepts the legal and constitutional way. Even \
the\\nvoting of the Constituent Assembly will not do away with hunger, \
or\\nbeat Wilhelm.... The issue of hunger and of surrendering \
Petrograd\\ncannot be decided by waiting for the Constituent Assembly. Hunger \
is\\nnot waiting. The peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution is not waiting. \
The Admirals\\nwho ran away did not wait.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Blind \
people are surprised that hungry people, betrayed by admirals\\nand generals, \
do not take an interest in voting.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]6. If the \
Kornilovtsi make an attempt, we would show them our\\nstrength. But why \
should we risk everything by making an attempt\\nourselves?\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Answer: History doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t repeat. \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Perhaps Kornilov will some day make\\nan attempt!\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] What a serious base for proletarian action! But \
suppose\\nKornilov waits for starvation, for the opening of the fronts, \
what\\nthen? This attitude means to build the tactics of a \
revolutionary\\nparty on one of the bourgeoisie\[CloseCurlyQuote]s former \
mistakes.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let us forget everything except that \
there is no way out but by the\\ndictatorship of the proletariat--either that \
or the dictatorship of\\nKornilov.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let us wait, \
comrades, for--a miracle!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n12.\\n\\nMILIUKOV\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s SPEECH \
(_Resum\[EAcute]_)\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Every one admits, it seems, \
that the defence of the country is our\\nprincipal task, and that, to assure \
it, we must have discipline in\\nthe Army and order in the rear. To achieve \
this, there must be a\\npower capable of daring, not only by persuasion, but \
also by force....\\nThe germ of all our evils comes from the point of view, \
original,\\ntruly Russian, concerning foreign policy, which passes for \
the\\nInternationalist point of view.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The noble \
Lenin only imitates the noble Keroyevsky when he holds\\nthat from Russia \
will come the New World which shall resuscitate the\\naged West, and which \
will replace the old banner of doctrinary\\nSocialism by the new direct \
action of starving masses--and that will\\npush humanity forward and force it \
to break in the doors of the\\nsocial paradise....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\nThese men sincerely believed that the decomposition of Russia \
would\\nbring about the decomposition of the whole capitalist r\[EAcute]gime.\
\\nStarting from that point of view, they were able to commit \
the\\nunconscious treason, in wartime, of calmly telling the soldiers \
to\\nabandon the trenches, and instead of fighting the external \
enemy,\\ncreating internal civil war and attacking the proprietors \
and\\ncapitalists....\\n\\nHere Miliukov was interrupted by furious cries \
from the Left,\\ndemanding what Socialist had ever advised such action....\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Martov says that only the revolutionary pressure of \
the proletariat\\ncan condemn and conquer the evil will of imperialist \
cliques and\\nbreak down the dictatorship of these cliques.... Not by an \
accord\\nbetween Governments for a limitation of armaments, but by \
the\\ndisarming of these Governments and the radical democratisation of \
the\\nmilitary system....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nHe attacked Martov \
viciously, and then turned on the Mensheviki and\\nSocialist Revolutionaries, \
whom he accused of entering the Government\\nas Ministers with the avowed \
purpose of carrying on the class\\nstruggle!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
Socialists of Germany and of the Allied countries contemplated\\nthese \
gentlemen with ill-concealed contempt, but they decided that it\\nwas for \
Russia, and sent us some apostles of the Universal\\nConflagration....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The formula of our democracy is very simple; no \
foreign policy, no\\nart of diplomacy, an immediate democratic peace, a \
declaration to the\\nAllies, \[OpenCurlyQuote]We want nothing, we haven\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t anything to fight with!\[CloseCurlyQuote] And\\nthen our \
adversaries will make the same declaration, and the\\nbrotherhood of peoples \
will be accomplished!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nMiliukov took a fling at \
the Zimmerwald Manifesto, and declared that\\neven Kerensky has not been able \
to escape the influence of \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]that\\nunhappy document \
which will forever be your indictment.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He \
then\\nattacked Skobeliev, whose position in foreign assemblies, where \
he\\nwould appear as a Russian delegate, yet opposed to the foreign \
policy\\nof his Government, would be so strange that people would say, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nthat gentleman carrying, and \
what shall we talk to him about?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] As for\\nthe \
_nakaz,_ Miliukov said that he himself was a pacifist; that he\\nbelieved in \
the creation of an International Arbitration Board, and\\nthe necessity for a \
limitation of armaments, and parliamentary\\ncontrol over secret diplomacy, \
which did not mean the abolition of\\nsecret diplomacy.\\n\\nAs for the \
Socialist ideas in the _nakaz,_ which he called \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Stockholm\\nideas\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]--peace \
without victory, the right of self-determination of\\npeoples, and \
renunciation of the economic war--\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The German \
successes are directly proportionate to the successes of\\nthose who call \
themselves the revolutionary democracy. I do not wish\\nto say, \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]to the successes of the Revolution,\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
because I believe that\\nthe defeats of the revolutionary democracy are \
victories for the\\nRevolution....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The influence \
of the Soviet leaders abroad is not unimportant. One\\nhad only to listen to \
the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs\\nto be convinced that, in this \
hall, the influence of the\\nrevolutionary democracy on foreign policy is so \
strong, that the\\nMinister does not dare to speak face to face with it about \
the honour\\nand dignity of Russia!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We can see, \
in the _nakaz_ of the Soviets, that the ideas of the\\nStockholm Manifesto \
have been elaborated in two direction--that of\\nUtopianism, and that of \
German interests....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nInterrupted by the angry \
cries of the Left, and rebuked by the\\nPresident, Miliukov insisted that the \
proposition of peace concluded\\nby popular assemblies, not by diplomats, and \
the proposal to\\nundertake peace negotiations as soon as the enemy had \
renounced\\nannexations, were pro-German. Recently Kuhlman said that a \
personal\\ndeclaration bound only him who made it.... \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Anyway, we will imitate the\\nGermans before we will \
imitate the Soviet of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe \
sections treating of the independence of Lithuania and Livonia\\nwere \
symptoms of nationalist agitation in different parts of Russia,\\nsupported, \
said Miliukov, by German money.... Amid bedlam from the\\nLeft, he contrasted \
the clauses of the _nakaz_ concerning\\nAlsace-Lorraine, Rumania, and Serbia, \
with those treating of the\\nnationalities in Germany and Austria. The \
_nakaz_ embraced the German\\nand Austrian point of view, said \
Miliukov.\\n\\nPassing to Terestchenko\[CloseCurlyQuote]s speech, he \
contemptuously accused him of\\nbeing afraid to speak the thought in his \
mind, and even afraid to\\nthink in terms of the greatness of Russia. The \
Dardanelles must\\nbelong to Russia....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are \
continually saying that the soldier does not know why he is\\nfighting, and \
that when he does know, he\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll fight.... It is true \
that\\nthe soldier doesn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t know why he is fighting, but now \
you have told\\nhim that there is no reason for him to fight, that we have no\
\\nnational interests, and that we are fighting for alien ends....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nPaying tribute to the Allies, who, he said, \
with the assistance of\\nAmerica, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]will yet save the \
cause of humanity,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he ended:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live the light of humanity, the advanced \
democracies of the\\nWest, who for a long time have been travelling the way \
we now only\\nbegin to enter, with ill-assured and hesitating steps! Long \
live our\\nbrave Allies!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n13.\\n\\nINTERVIEW WITH \
KERENSKY\\n\\nThe Associated Press man tried his hand. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Mr. Kerensky,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] he began,\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]in England and France people are disappointed with the \
Revolution----\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Yes, I \
know,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] interrupted Kerensky, quizzically. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Abroad the\\nRevolution is no longer fashionable!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What is your explanation \
of why the Russians have stopped fighting?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]That is a foolish question to ask.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Kerensky was annoyed. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Russia\\nentered the war first of all the Allies, and \
for a long time she bore\\nthe whole brunt of it. Her losses have been \
inconceivably greater\\nthan those of all the other nations put together. \
Russia has now the\\nright to demand of the Allies that they bring greater \
force of arms\\nto bear.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] He stopped for a moment and \
stared at his interlocutor.\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are asking why the \
Russians have stopped fighting, and the\\nRussians are asking where is the \
British fleet--with German\\nbattle-ships in the Gulf of Riga?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Again he ceased suddenly, and as\\nsuddenly burst \
out. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Russian Revolution hasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t \
failed and the\\nrevolutionary Army hasn\[CloseCurlyQuote]t failed. It is not \
the Revolution which\\ncaused disorganisation in the army--that \
disorganisation was\\naccomplished years ago, by the old regime. Why aren\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]t the Russians\\nfighting? I will tell you. Because the \
masses of the people are\\neconomically exhausted,--and because they are \
disillusioned with the\\nAllies!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe interview \
of which this is an excerpt was cabled to the United\\nStates, and in a few \
days sent back by the American State Department,\\nwith a demand that it be \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]altered.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] This Kerensky refused \
to do; but\\nit was done by his secretary, Dr. David Soskice--and, thus \
purged of\\nall offensive references to the Allies, was given to the press of \
the\\nworld....\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER III\\n\\n1.\\n\\nRESOLUTION OF \
THE FACTORY-SHOP COMMITTEES\\n\\n_Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control_\\n\\n1. \
(See page 43)\\n\\n2. The organisation of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control \
is a manifestation of the\\nsame healthy activity in the sphere of industrial \
production, as are\\nparty organisations in the sphere of politics, trade \
unions in\\nemployment, Cooperatives in the domain of consumption, and \
literary\\nclubs in the sphere of culture.\\n\\n3. The working-class has much \
more interest in the proper and\\nuninterrupted operation of factories... \
than the capitalist class.\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control is a better \
security in this respect for the\\ninterests of modern society, of the whole \
people, than the arbitrary\\nwill of the owners, who are guided only by their \
selfish desire for\\nmaterial profits or political privileges. Therefore \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control\\nis demanded by the proletariat not only \
in their own interest, but in\\nthe interest of the whole country, and should \
be supported by the\\nrevolutionary peasantry as well as the revolutionary \
Army.\\n\\n4. Considering the hostile attitude of the majority of the \
capitalist\\nclass toward the Revolution, experience shows that \
proper\\ndistribution of raw materials and fuel, as well as the most \
efficient\\nmanagement of factories, is impossible without Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control.\\n\\n5. Only Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control \
over capitalist enterprises, cultivating the\\nworkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
conscious attitude toward work, and making clear its social\\nmeaning, can \
create conditions favourable to the development of a\\nfirm self-discipline \
in labour, and the development of all labour\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\npossible \
productivity.\\n\\n6. The impending transformation of industry from a war to \
a peace\\nbasis, and the redistribution of labour all over the country, as \
well\\nas among the different factories, can be accomplished without \
great\\ndisturbances only by means of the democratic self-government of \
the\\nworkers themselves.... Therefore the realisation of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control is\\nan indispensable preliminary to the \
demobilisation of industry.\\n\\n7. In accordance with the slogan proclaimed \
by the Russian Social\\nDemocratic Labour Party (Bolsheviki), Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control on a national\\nscale, in order to bring results, \
must extend to all capitalist\\nconcerns, and not be organised accidentally, \
without system; it must\\nbe well-planned, and not separated from the \
industrial life of the\\ncountry as a whole.\\n\\n8. The economic life of the \
country--agriculture, industry, commerce\\nand transport--must be subjected \
to one unified plan, constructed so\\nas to satisfy the individual and social \
requirements of the wide\\nmasses of the people; it must be approved by their \
elected\\nrepresentatives, and carried out under the direction of \
these\\nrepresentatives by means of national and local organisations.\\n\\n9. \
That part of the plan which deals with land-labour must be carried\\nout \
under supervision of the peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] and land-workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\norganisations; that relating to industry, trade and \
transport\\noperated by wage-earners, by means of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Control; the natural\\norgans of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control inside the \
industrial plant will be the\\nFactory-Shop and similar Committees; and in \
the labour market, the\\nTrade Unions.\\n\\n10. The collective wage \
agreements arranged by the Trade Unions for\\nthe majority of workers in any \
branch of labour, must be binding on\\nall the owners of plants employing \
this kind of labour in the given\\ndistrict.\\n\\n11. Employment bureaus must \
be placed under the control and\\nmanagement of the Trade Unions, as class \
organisations acting within\\nthe limits of the whole industrial plan, and in \
accordance with it.\\n\\n12. Trade Unions must have the right, upon their own \
initiative, to\\nbegin legal action against all employers who violate labour \
contracts\\nor labour legislation, and also in behalf of any individual \
worker in\\nany branch of labour.\\n\\n13. On all questions relating to \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control over production,\\ndistribution and \
employment, the Trade Unions must confer with the\\nworkers of individual \
establishments through their Factory-Shop\\nCommittees.\\n\\n14. Matters of \
employment and discharge, vacations, wage scales,\\nrefusal of work, degree \
of productivity and skill, reasons for\\nabrogating agreements, disputes with \
the administration, and similar\\nproblems of the internal life of the \
factory, must be settled\\nexclusively according to the findings of the \
Factory-Shop Committee,\\nwhich has the right to exclude from participation \
in the discussion\\nany members of the factory administration.\\n\\n15. The \
Factory-Shop Committee forms a commission to control the\\nsupplying of the \
factory with raw materials, fuel, orders, labour\\npower and technical staff \
(including equipment), and all other\\nsupplies and arrangements, and also to \
assure the factory\[CloseCurlyQuote]s adherence\\nto the general industrial \
plan. The factory administration is obliged\\nto surrender to the organs of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control, for their aid and\\ninformation, all data \
concerning the business; to make it possible to\\nverify this data, and to \
produce the books of the company upon demand\\nof the Factory-Shop Committee.\
\\n\\n16. Any illegal acts on the part of the administration discovered \
by\\nthe Factory-Shop Committees, or any suspicion of such illegal \
acts,\\nwhich cannot be investigated or remedied by the workers alone, \
shall\\nbe referred to the district central organisation of \
Factory-Shop\\nCommittees charged with the particular branch of labour \
involved,\\nwhich shall discuss the matter with the institutions charged with \
the\\nexecution of the general industrial plan, and find means to deal \
with\\nthe matter, even to the extent of confiscating the factory.\\n\\n17. \
The union of the Factory-Shop Committees of different concerns\\nmust be \
accomplished on the basis of the different trades, in order\\nto facilitate \
control over the whole branch of industry, so as to\\ncome within the general \
industrial plan; and so as to create an\\neffective plan of distribution \
among the different factories of\\norders, raw materials, fuel, technical and \
labour power; and also to\\nfacilitate cooperation with the Trade Unions, \
which are organised by\\ntrades.\\n\\n18. The central city councils of Trade \
Unions and Factory-Shop\\nCommittees represent the proletariat in the \
corresponding provincial\\nand local institutions formed to elaborate and \
carry out the general\\nindustrial plan, and to organise economic relations \
between the towns\\nand the villages (workers and peasants). They also \
possess final\\nauthority for the management of Factory-Shop Committees and \
Trade\\nUnions, so far as Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control in their district \
is concerned,\\nand they shall issue obligatory regulations concerning \
workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\ndiscipline in the routine of production--which \
regulations, however,\\nmust be approved by vote of the workers \
themselves.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTHE BOURGEOIS PRESS ON THE BOLSHEVIKI\\n\\n_Russkaya \
Volia,_ October 28. \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The decisive moment approaches.... \
It is\\ndecisive for the Bolsheviki. Either they will give us... a \
second\\nedition of the events of July 16-18, or they will have to admit that\
\\nwith their plans and intentions, with their impertinent policy \
of\\nwishing to separate themselves from everything consciously \
national,\\nthey have been definitely defeated....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What are the chances of Bolshevik success?\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is difficult to answer that question, for their \
principal support\\nis the... ignorance of the popular masses. They speculate \
on it, they\\nwork upon it by a demagogy which nothing can stop....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government must play its part in this affair. \
Supporting itself\\nmorally by the Council of the Republic, the Government \
must take a\\nclearly-defined attitude toward the Bolsheviki....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]And if the Bolsheviki provoke an insurrection against \
the legal\\npower, and thus facilitate the German invasion, they must be \
treated\\nas mutineers and \
traitors....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n_Birzhevya Viedomosti,_ October 28. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Now that the Bolsheviki have\\nseparated themselves \
from the rest of the democracy, the struggle\\nagainst them is very much \
simpler--and it is not reasonable, in order\\nto fight against Bolshevism, to \
wait until they make a manifestation.\\nThe Government should not even allow \
the manifestation....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The appeals of the \
Bolsheviki to insurrection and anarchy are acts\\npunishable by the criminal \
courts, and in the freest countries, their\\nauthors would receive severe \
sentences. For what the Bolsheviki are\\ncarrying on is not a political \
struggle against the Government, or\\neven for the power; it is propaganda \
for anarchy, massacres, and\\ncivil war. This propaganda must be extirpated \
at its roots; it would\\nbe strange to wait, in order to begin action against \
an agitation for\\n_pogroms,_ until the _pogroms_ actually occurred....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n_Novoye Vremya,_ November 1. \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... Why is the Government excited\\nonly about \
November 2d (date of calling of the Congress of Soviets),\\nand not about \
September 12th, or October 3d?\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]This is not the \
first time that Russia burns and falls in ruins, and\\nthat the smoke of the \
terrible conflagration makes the eyes of our\\nAllies smart....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Since it came to power, has there been a single order \
issued by the\\nGovernment for the purpose of halting anarchy, or has any one\
\\nattempted to put out the Russian conflagration?\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]There were other things to do....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government turned its attention to a more \
immediate problem. It\\ncrushed an insurrection (the Kornilov attempt) \
concerning which every\\none is now asking, \[OpenCurlyQuote]Did it ever \
exist?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n3.\\n\\nMODERATE SOCIALIST PRESS ON THE \
BOLSHEVIKI\\n\\n_Dielo Naroda,_ October 28 (Socialist Revolutionary). \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The most\\nfrightful crime of the Bolsheviki against \

revolutionary\\nGovernment all the calamities which the masses are so cruelly\
\\nsuffering; when as a matter of fact these calamities spring \
from\\nobjective causes.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]They make golden \
promises to the masses, knowing in advance that\\nthey can fulfil none of \
them; they lead the masses on a false trail,\\ndeceiving them as to the \
source of all their troubles....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Bolsheviki \
are the most dangerous enemies of the \

\[OpenCurlyQuote]the freedom\\nof the press\[CloseCurlyQuote]?...\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government ought to defend itself and defend us. \
We have the\\nright to insist that the Government machinery does not remain \

\[CloseCurlyQuote]s paper, _Yedinstvo,_ suspended publication a few \
weeks\\nafter the Bolsheviki seized the power. Contrary to popular \
report,\\n_Yedinstvo_ was not suppressed by the Soviet Government; \

to\\ncontinue _because there were too few subscribers_....\\n\\n5.\\n\\nWERE \
THE BOLSHEVIKI CONSPIRATORS?\\n\\nThe French newspaper _Entente_ of \
Petrograd, on November 15th,\\npublished an article of which the following is \
a part:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government of Kerensky discusses and \

that is wrong.\\nGovernment of usurpers, yes, like all revolutionary \
Governments which\\ntriumph over their adversaries. Conspirators--no!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]No! They did not conspire. On the contrary, openly, \
audaciously,\\nwithout mincing words, without dissimulating their intentions, \
they\\nmultiplied their agitation, intensified their propaganda in \
the\\nfactories, the barracks, at the Front, in the country, \

this power by violence, at a moment when\\na Government crisis will \

\\n\\nEVENTS OF THE NIGHT, NOVEMBER 6TH\\n\\nToward evening bands of Red \
Guards began to occupy the printing shops\\nof the bourgeois press, where \
they printed _Rabotchi Put, Soldat,_\\nand various proclamations by the \
hundred thousand. The City Militia\\nwas ordered to clear these places, but \
found the offices barricaded,\\nand armed men defending them. Soldiers who \
were ordered to attack the\\nprint-shops refused.\\n\\nAbout midnight a \
Colonel with a company of _yunkers_ arrived at the\\nclub \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Free Mind,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] with a warrant to \
arrest the editor of _Rabotchi\\nPut._ Immediately an enormous mob gathered \
in the street outside and\\nthreatened to lynch the _yunkers._ The Colonel \
thereupon begged that\\nhe and the _yunkers_ be arrested and taken to \
Peter-Paul prison for\\nsafety. This request was granted.\\n\\nAt 1 A. M. a \
detachment of soldiers and sailors from Smolny occupied\\nthe Telegraph \
Agency. At 1.35 the Post Office was occupied. Toward\\nmorning the Military \
Hotel was taken, and at 5 o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock the Telephone\\nExchange. \
At dawn the State Bank was surrounded. And at 10 A. M. a\\ncordon of troops \
was drawn about the Winter Palace.\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER \
IV\\n\\n1.\\n\\nEVENTS OF NOVEMBER 7TH\\n\\nFrom 4 A. M. until dawn Kerensky \
remained at the Petrograd Staff\\nHeadquarters, sending orders to the \
Cossacks and to the _yunkers_ in\\nthe Officers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Schools in \
and around Petrograd--all of whom answered\\nthat they were unable to \
move.\\n\\nColonel Polkovnikov, Commandant of the City, hurried between \
the\\nStaff and the Winter Palace, evidently without any plan. \
Kerensky\\ngave an order to open the bridges; three hours passed without \
any\\naction, and then an officer and five men went out on their \
own\\ninitiative, and putting to flight a picket of Red Guards, opened \
the\\nNicolai Bridge. Immediately after they left, however, some \
sailors\\nclosed it again.\\n\\nKerensky ordered the print-shop of _Rabotchi \
Put_ to be occupied. The\\nofficer detailed to the work was promised a squad \
of soldiers; two\\nhours later he was promised some _yunkers;_ then the order \
was\\nforgotten.\\n\\nAn attempt was made to recapture the Post Office and \
the Telegraph\\nAgency; a few shots were fired, and the Government troops \
announced\\nthat they would no longer oppose the Soviets.\\n\\nTo a \

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Petrograd Soviet.... has declared the Provisional \

turned\\nover to it, under threat of bombarding the Winter Palace with \
the\\ncannon of Peter-Paul Fortress, and of the cruiser _Avrora,_ \
anchored\\nin the Neva.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Government can \
surrender its authority only to the Consituent\\nAssembly; for that reason it \
has decided not to submit, and to demand\\naid from the population and the \
Army. A telegram has been sent to the\\n_Stavka;_ and an answer received says \
that a strong detachment of\\ntroops is being sent....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Let the Army and the People reject the irresponsible \
attempts of the\\nBolsheviki to create a revolt in the rear....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAbout 9 A. M. Kerensky left for the \
Front....\\n\\nToward evening two soldiers on bicycles presented themselves \
at the\\nStaff Headquarters, as delegates of the garrison of \
Peter-Paul\\nFortress. Entering the meeting-room of the Staff, where Kishkin,\
\\nRutenburg, Paltchinski, General Bagratouni, Colonel Paradielov and\\nCount \
Tolstoy were gathered, they demanded the immediate surrender of\\nthe Staff; \
threatening, in case of refusal, to bombard headquarters....\\nAfter two \
panicky conferences the Staff retreated to the Winter\\nPalace, and the \
headquarters were occupied by Red Guards....\\n\\nLate in the afternoon \
several Bolshevik armoured cars cruised around\\nthe Palace Square, and \
Soviet soldiers tried unsuccessfully to parley\\nwith the \
_yunkers_....\\n\\nFiring on the Palace began about 7 \
o\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock in the evening....\\n\\nAt 10 P. M. began an \
artillery bombardment from three sides, in which\\nmost of the shells were \
blanks, only three small shrapnels striking\\nthe facade of the Palace....\\n\
\\n2.\\n\\nKERENSKY IN FLIGHT\\n\\nLeaving Petrograd in the morning of \
November 7th, Kerensky arrived by\\nautomobile at Gatchina, where he demanded \
a special train. Toward\\nevening he was in Ostrov, Province of Pskov. The \
next morning,\\nextraordinary session of the local Soviet of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDepulies, with \
participation of Cossack delegates--there being 6,000\\nCossacks at \
Ostrov.\\n\\nKerensky spoke to the assembly, appealing for aid against \
the\\nBolsheviki, and addressed himself almost exclusively to the \
Cossacks.\\nThe soldier delegates protested.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Why \
did you come here?\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] shouted voices. Kerensky answered, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To ask\\nthe Cossacks\[CloseCurlyQuote] assistance in \
crushing the Bolshevik insurrection!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] At\\nthis there \
were violent protestations, which increased when he\\ncontinued, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I broke the Kornilov attempt, and I will break \
the\\nBolsheviki!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] The noise became so great that he \
had to leave the\\nplatform....\\n\\nThe soldier deputies and the Ussuri \
Cossacks decided to arrest\\nKerensky, but the Don Cossacks prevented them, \
and got him away by\\ntrain.... A Military Revolutionary Committee, set up \
during the day,\\ntried to inform the garrison of Pskov; but the telephone \
and\\ntelegraph lines were cut....\\n\\nKerensky did not arrive at Pskov. \
Revolutionary soldiers had cut the\\nrailway line, to prevent troops being \
sent against the capital. On\\nthe night of November 8th he arrived by \
automobile at Luga, where he\\nwas well received by the Death Battalions \
stationed there.\\n\\nNext day he took train for the South-West Front, and \
visited the Army\\nCommittee at headquarters. The Fifth Army, however, was \
wild with\\nenthusiasm over the news of the Bolshevik success, and the \
Army\\nCommittee was unable to promise Kerensky any support.\\n\\nFrom there \
he went to the _Stavka,_ at Moghilev, where he ordered ten\\nregiments from \
different parts of the Front to move against\\nPetrograd. The soldiers almost \
unanimously refused; and those\\nregiments which did start halted on the way. \
About five thousand\\nCossacks finally followed him....\\n\\n3.\\n\\nLOOTING \
OF THE WINTER PALACE\\n\\nI do not mean to maintain that there was no \
looting, in the Winter\\nPalace. Both after and _before_ the Winter Palace \
fell, there was\\nconsiderable pilfering. The statement of the Socialist \
Revolutionary\\npaper _Narod,_ and of members of the City Duma, to the effect \
that\\nprecious objects to the value of 500,000,000 rubles had been \
stolen,\\nwas, however, a gross exaggeration.\\n\\nThe most important art \
treasures of the Palace--paintings, statues,\\ntapestries, rare porcelains \
and armorie,--had been transferred to\\nMoscow during the month of September; \
and they were still in good\\norder in the basement of the Imperial Palace \
there ten days after the\\ncapture of the Kremlin by Bolshevik troops. I can \
personally testify\\nto this....\\n\\nIndividuals, however, especially the \
general public, which was\\nallowed to circulate freely through the Winter \
Palace for several\\ndays after its capture, made away with table silver, \
clocks, bedding,\\nmirrors and some odd vases of valuable porcelain and \
semi-precious\\nstone, to the value of about $50,000.\\n\\nThe Soviet \
Government immediately created a special commission,\\ncomposed of artists \
and arch\[AE]ologists, to recover the stolen objects.\\nOn November 1st two \
proclamations were issued:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]CITIZENS OF PETROGRAD!\
\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We urgently ask all citizens to exert every \
effort to find whatever\\npossible of the objects stolen from the Winter \
Palace in the night of\\nNovember 7-8, and to forward them to the Commandant \

\\nImmediately following the taking of the Winter Palace all sorts \
of\\nsensational stories were published in the anti-Bolshevik press, \
and\\ntold in the City Duma, about the fate of the Women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Battalion\\ndefending the Palace. It was said that some of the girl-soldiers \
had\\nbeen thrown from the windows into the street, most of the rest \
had\\nbeen violated, and many had committed suicide as a result of \
the\\nhorrors they had gone through.\\n\\nThe City Duma appointed a \
commission to investigate the matter. On\\nNovember 16th the commission \
returned from Levashovo, headquarters of\\nthe Women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Battalion. Madame Tyrkova reported that the girls had\\nbeen at first taken \
to the barracks of the Pavlovsky Regiment, and\\nthat there some of them had \
been badly treated; but that at present\\nmost of them were at Levashovo, and \
the rest scattered about the city\\nin private houses. Dr. Mandelbaum, \
another of the commission,\\ntestified drily that _none_ of the women had \
been thrown out of the\\nwindows of the Winter Palace, that _none_ were \
wounded, that three\\nhad been violated, and that one had committed suicide, \
leaving a note\\nwhich said that she had been \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]disappointed in her ideals.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\
\\nOn November 21st the Military Revolutionary Committee \
officially\\ndissolved the Women\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Battalion, at the request \
of the girls\\nthemselves, who returned to civilian clothes.\\n\\nIn Louise \

V\\n\\n1.\\n\\nAPPEALS AND PROCLAMATIONS\\n\\n_From the Military \
Revolutionary Committee,_ November 8:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To All Army \
Committees and All Soviets of Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Petrograd garrison has overturned the Government \
of Kerensky,\\nwhich had risen against the Revolution and the People.... In \
sending\\nthis news to the Front and the country, the Military \
Revolutionary\\nCommittee requests all soldiers to keep vigilant watch on the \
conduct\\nof officers. Officers who do not frankly and openly declare for the\
\\nRevolution should be immediately arrested as enemies.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Petrograd Soviet interprets the programme of the \
new Government\\nas: immediate proposals of a general democratic peace, the \
immediate\\ntransfer of great landed estates to the peasants, and the \
honest\\nconvocation of the Constituent Assembly. The \
people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s revolutionary\\nArmy must not permit troops of \
doubtful morale to be sent to\\nPetrograd. Act by means of arguments, by \
means of moral suasion--but\\nif that fails, halt the movement of troops by \
implacable force.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The present order must be \
immediately read to all military units of\\nevery branch of the service. \
Whoever keeps the knowledge of this\\norder from the soldier-masses.... \
commits a serious crime against the\\nRevolution, and will be punished with \
all the rigour of revolutionary\\nlaw.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Soldiers! \
For peace, bread, land, and popular government!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n \
                       *     *     *     *     \
*\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To All Front and Rear Army, Corps, Divisional, \
Regimental and\\nCompany Committees, and All Soviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Soldiers and \
Revolutionary Officers!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Military \
Revolutionary Committee, by agreement with the majority\\nof the workers, \
soldiers, and peasants, has decreed that General\\nKornilov and all the \
accomplices of his conspiracy shall be brought\\nimmediately to Petrograd, \
for incarceration in Peter-Paul Fortress\\nand arraignment before a military \
revolutionary court-martial....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All who resist \
the execution of this decree are declared by the\\nCommittee to be traitors \
to the Revolution, and their orders are\\nherewith declared null and void.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n          _The Military Revolutionary Committee \
Attached to the Petrograd\\n                        Soviet of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies._\\n\\n            \
            *     *     *     *     *\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To all \
Provincial and District Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]By resolution of the All-Russian Congress of Soviets, \
all arrested\\nmembers of Land Committees are immediately set free. The \
Commissars\\nwho arrested them are to be arrested.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]From this moment all power belongs to the Soviets. The \
Commissars of\\nthe Provisional Government are removed. The presidents of the \
various\\nlocal Soviets are invited to enter into direct relations with \
the\\nrevolutionary Government.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n                 \
               _Military Revolutionary Committee._\\n\\n2.\\n\\nPROTEST OF \
THE MUNICIPAL DUMA\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Central City Duma, elected \
on the most democratic principles,\\nhas undertaken the burden of managing \
Municipal affairs and food\\nsupplies at the time of the greatest \
disorganisation. At the present\\nmoment the Bolshevik party, three weeks \
before the elections to the\\nConstituent Assembly, and in spite of the \
menace of the external\\nenemy, having removed by armed force the only legal \
revolutionary\\nauthority, is making an attempt against the rights and \
independence\\nof the Municipal Self-Government, demanding submission to \
its\\nCommissars and its illegal authority.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In \
this terrible and tragic moment the Petrograd City Duma, in the\\nface of its \
constituents, and of all Russia, declares loudly that it\\nwill not submit to \
any encroachments on its rights and its\\nindependence, and will remain at \
the post of responsibility to which\\nit has been called by the will of the \
population of the capital.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Central City Duma \
of Petrograd appeals to all Dumas and Zemstvos\\nof the Russian Republic to \
rally to the defence of one of the\\ngreatest conquests of the Russian \
Revolution--the independence and\\ninviolability of popular self-government.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n3.\\n\\nLAND DECREE--PEASANTS\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]NAKAZ\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe Land question \
can only be permanently settled by the general\\nConstituent \
Assembly.\\n\\nThe most equitable solution of the Land question should be as \
follows:\\n\\n1. The right of private ownership of land is abolished forever; \
land\\ncannot be sold, nor leased, nor mortgaged, nor alienated in any \
way.\\nAll dominical lands, lands attached to titles, lands belonging to \
the\\nEmperor\[CloseCurlyQuote]s cabinet, to monasteries, churches, \
possession lands,\\nentailed lands, private estates, communal lands, peasant \
free-holds,\\nand others, are confiscated without compensation, and become \
national\\nproperty, and are placed at the disposition of the workers \
who\\ncultivate them.\\n\\nThose who are damaged because of this social \
transformation of the\\nrights of property are entitled to public aid during \
the time\\nnecessary for them to adapt themselves to the new conditions \
of\\nexistence.\\n\\n2. All the riches beneath the earth--ores, oil, coal, \
salt, etc.--as\\nwell as forests and waters having a national importance, \
become the\\nexclusive property of the State. All minor streams, lakes and \
forests\\nare placed in the hands of the communities, on condition of \
being\\nmanaged by the local organs of government.\\n\\n3. All plots of land \
scientifically cultivated--gardens, plantations,\\nnurseries, seed-plots, \
green-houses, and others--shall not be divided,\\nbut transformed into model \
farms, and pass into the hands of the\\nState or of the community, according \
to their size and importance.\\n\\nBuildings, communal lands and villages \
with their private gardens and\\ntheir orchards remain in the hands of their \
present owners; the\\ndimensions of these plots and the rate of taxes for \
their use shall\\nbe fixed by law.\\n\\n4. All studs, governmental and \
private cattle-breeding and\\nbird-breeding establishments, and others, are \
confiscated and become\\nnational property, and are transferred either to the \
State or to the\\ncommunity, according to their size and importance.\\n\\nAll \
questions of compensation for the above are within the competence\\nof the \
Constituent Assembly.\\n\\n5. All inventoried agricultural property of the \
confiscated lands,\\nmachinery and live-stock, are transferred without \
compensation to\\nthe State or the community, according to their quantity and\
\\nimportance.\\n\\nThe confiscation of such machinery or live-stock shall \
not apply to\\nthe small properties of peasants.\\n\\n6. The right to use the \
land is granted to all citizens, without\\ndistinction of sex, who wish to \
work the land themselves, with the\\nhelp of their families, or in \
partnership, and only so long as they\\nare able to work. No hired labour is \
permitted.\\n\\nIn the event of the incapacity for work of a member of the \
commune\\nfor a period of two years, the commune shall be bound to render him\
\\nassistance during this time by working his land in common.\\n\\nFarmers \
who through old age or sickness have permanently lost the\\ncapacity to work \
the land themselves, shall surrender their land and\\nreceive instead a \
Government pension.\\n\\n7. The use of the land should be equalised--that is \
to say, the land\\nshall be divided among the workers according to local \
conditions, the\\nunit of labour and the needs of the individual.\\n\\nThe \
way in which land is to be used may be individually determined\\nupon: as \
homesteads, as farms, by communes, by partnerships, as will\\nbe decided by \
the villages and settlements.\\n\\n8. All land upon its confiscation is \
pooled in the general People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nLand Fund. Its distribution \
among the workers is carried out by the\\nlocal and central organs of \
administration, beginning with the\\nvillage democratic organisations and \
ending with the central\\nprovincial institutions--with the exception of \
urban and rural\\ncooperative societies.\\n\\nThe Land Fund is subject to \
periodical redistribution according to\\nthe increase of population and the \
development of productivity and\\nrural economy.\\n\\nIn case of modification \
of the boundaries of allotments, the original\\ncentre of the allotment \
remains intact.\\n\\nThe lands of persons retiring from the community return \
to the Land\\nFund; providing that near relatives of the persons retiring, or\
\\nfriends designated by them, shall have preference in the\\nredistribution \
of these lands.\\n\\nWhen lands are returned to the Land Fund, the money \
expended for\\nmanuring or improving the land, which has not been exhausted, \
shall\\nbe reimbursed.\\n\\nIf in some localities the Land Fund is \
insufficient to satisfy the\\nlocal population, the surplus population should \
emigrate.\\n\\nThe organisation of the emigration, also the costs thereof, \
and the\\nproviding of emigrants with the necessary machinery and live-stock,\
\\nshall be the business of the State.\\n\\nThe emigration shall be carried \
out in the following order: first,\\nthe peasants without land who express \
their wish to emigrate; then\\nthe undesirable members of the community, \
deserters, etc., and\\nfinally, by drawing lots on agreement.\\n\\nAll which \
is contained in this _nakaz,_ being the expression of the\\nindisputable will \
of the great majority of conscious peasants of\\nRussia, is declared to be a \
temporary law, and until the convocation\\nof the Constituent Assembly, \
becomes effective immediately so far as\\nis possible, and in some parts of \
it gradually, as will be determined\\nby the District Soviets of Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\n4.\\n\\nTHE LAND AND DESERTERS\\n\\nThe \
Government was not forced to make any decision concerning the\\nrights of \
deserters to the land. The end of the war and the\\ndemobilisation of the \
army automatically removed the deserter\\nproblem....\\n\\n5.\\n\\nTHE \
COUNCIL OF PEOPLE\[CloseCurlyQuote]S COMMISSARS\\n\\nThe Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars was at first composed entirely \
of\\nBolsheviki. This was not entirely the fault of the \
Bolsheviki,\\nhowever. On November 8th they offered portfolios to members of \
the\\nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries, who declined. See page 273. {of \
original\\nvolume}\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER VI\\n\\n1.\\n\\nAPPEALS AND \
DENUNCIATIONS\\n\\nAppeal to all Citizens and to the Military Organisations \
of the\\nSocialist Revolutionary Party.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
senseless attempt of the Bolsheviki is on the eve of complete\\nfailure. The \
garrison is disaffected.... The Ministries are idle, bread\\nis lacking. All \
factions except a handful of Bolsheviki have left the\\nCongress of Soviets. \
The Bolsheviki are alone! Abuses of all sorts,\\nacts of vandalism and \
pillage, the bombardment of the Winter Palace,\\narbitrary arrests--all these \
crimes committed by the Bolsheviki have\\naroused against them the resentment \
of the majority of the sailors\\nand soldiers. The _Tsentroflot_ refuses to \
submit to the orders of\\nthe Bolsheviki....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We \
call upon all sane elements to gather around the Committee for\\nSalvation of \
Country and Revolution; to take serious measures to be\\nready, at the first \
call of the Central Committee of the Party, to\\nact against the \
counter-revolutionists, who will doubtless attempt to\\nprofit by these \
troubles provoked by the Bolshevik adventure, and to\\nwatch closely the \
external enemy, who also would like to take\\nadvantage of this opportune \
moment when the Front is weakened....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n       \

with Kornilov and\\nKishkin.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A criminal and a \
traitor to the workers, soldiers and peasants, who\\nbelieved in him.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kerensky? A murderer of soldiers!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kerensky? A public executioner of peasants!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kerensky? A strangler of workers!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Such is the second Kornilov who now wants to butcher \
Liberty!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER \
VII\\n\\n1.\\n\\nTWO DECREES\\n\\n_On the Press_\\n\\nIn the serious decisive \
hour of the Revolution and the days immediately\\nfollowing it, the \
Provisional Revolutionary Committee is compelled to\\nadopt a series of \
measures against the counter-revolutionary press of\\nall \
shades.\\n\\nImmediately on all sides there are cries that the new \
Socialist\\nauthority is in this violating the essential principles of its \
own\\nprogramme by an attempt against the freedom of the press.\\n\\nThe \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government calls the \
attention of the\\npopulation to the fact that in our country, behind this \
liberal\\nshield, is hidden the opportunity for the wealthier classes to \
seize\\nthe lion\[CloseCurlyQuote]s share of the whole press, and by this \
means to poison the\\npopular mind and bring confusion into the consciousness \
of the masses.\\n\\nEvery one knows that the bourgeois press is one of the \
most powerful\\nweapons of the bourgeoisie. Especially in this critical \
moment, when\\nthe new authority of the workers and peasants is in process of\
\\nconsolidation, it is impossible to leave it in the hands of the\\nenemy, \
at a time when it is not less dangerous than bombs and\\nmachine-guns. This \
is why temporary and extraordinary measures have\\nbeen adopted for the \
purpose of stopping the flow of filth and\\ncalumny in which the yellow and \
green press would be glad to drown\\nthe young victory of the people.\\n\\nAs \
soon as the new order is consolidated, all administrative measures\\nagainst \
the press will be suspended; full liberty will be given it\\nwithin the \
limits of responsibility before the law, in accordance\\nwith the broadest \
and most progressive regulations....\\n\\nBearing in mind, however, the fact \
that any restrictions of the\\nfreedom of the press, even in critical \
moments, are admissible only\\nwithin the bounds of necessity, the Council of \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars\\ndecrees as follows:\\n\\n1. The \
following classes of newspapers shall be subject to closure:\\n(a) Those \
inciting to open resistance or disobedience to the \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government; (b) \
Those creating confusion by obviously\\nand deliberately perverting the news; \
(c) Those inciting to acts of a\\ncriminal character punishable by the \
laws.\\n\\n2. The temporary or permanent closing of any organ of the press \
shall\\nbe carried out only by virtue of a resolution of the Council \
of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\\n3. The present decree is of a \
temporary nature, and will be revoked\\nby a special _ukaz_ when normal \
conditions of public life are\\nre-established.\\n\\n     _President of the \
Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars,_\\n\\n        VLADIMIR \
ULIANOV (LENIN).\\n\\n                        *     *     *     *     \
*\\n\\n_On Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Militia_\\n\\n1. All Soviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies shall form \
a\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Militia.\\n\\n2. This Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Militia shall be entirely at the orders of the\\nSoviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\n3. Military \
and civil authorities must render every assistance in\\narming the workers \
and in supplying them with technical equipment,\\neven to the extent of \
requisitioning arms belonging to the War\\nDepartment of the \
Government.\\n\\n4. This decree shall be promulgated by telegraph. Petrograd, \
November\\n10, 1917.\\n\\n            _People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar of \
the Interior_\\n\\n                A. I. RYKOV.\\n\\nThis decree encouraged \
the formation of companies of Red Guards all\\nover Russia, which became the \
most valuable arm of the Soviet\\nGovernment in the ensuing civil \
war.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nTHE STRIKE FUND\\n\\nThe fund for the striking Government \
employees and bank clerks was\\nsubscribed by banks and business houses of \
Petrograd and other\\ncities, and also by foreign corporations doing business \
in Russia.\\nAll who consented to strike against the Bolsheviki were paid \
full\\nwages, and in some cases their pay was increased. It was \
the\\nrealisation of the strike fund contributors that the Bolsheviki \
were\\nfirmly in power, followed by their refusal to pay strike \
benefits,\\nwhich finally broke the strike.\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER \
VIII\\n\\n1.\\n\\nKERENSKY\[CloseCurlyQuote]S ADVANCE\\n\\nOn November 9th \
Kerensky and his Cossacks arrived at Gatchina, where\\nthe garrison, \
hopelessly split into two factions, immediately\\nsurrendered. The members of \
the Gatchina Soviet were arrested, and at\\nfirst threatened with death; \
later they were released on good\\nbehaviour.\\n\\nThe Cossack \
advance-guards, practically unopposed, occupied Pavlovsk,\\nAlexandrovsk and \
other stations, and reached the outskirts of\\nTsarskoye Selo next \
morning--November 10th. At once the garrison\\ndivided into three groups--the \
officers, loyal to Kerenskly; part of\\nthe soldiers and non-commissioned \
officers, who declared themselves\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]neutral\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]; and most of the rank and file, who were for \
the\\nBolsheviki. The Bolshevik soldiers, who were without leaders \
or\\norganisation, fell back toward the capital. The local Soviet \
also\\nwithdrew to the village of Pulkovo.\\n\\nFrom Pulkovo six members of \
the Tsarskoye Selo Soviet went with an\\nautomobile-load of proclamations to \
Gatchina, to propagandise the\\nCossacks. They spent most of the day going \
around Gatchina from one\\nCossack barracks to another, pleading, arguing and \
explaining. Toward\\nevening some officers discovered their presence and they \
were\\narrested and brought before General Krasnov, who said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You fought\\nagainst Kornilov; now you are opposing \
Kerensky. I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ll have you \
all\\nshot!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAfter reading aloud to them the \
order appointing him\\ncommander-in-chief of the Petrograd District, Krasnov \
asked if they\\nwere Bolsheviki. They replied in the affirmative--upon which \
Krasnov\\nwent away; a short time later an officer came and set them \
free,\\nsaying that it was by order of General Krasnov....\\n\\nIn the \
meanwhile delegations continued to arrive from Petrograd; from\\nthe Duma, \
the Committee for Salvation, and, last of all, from the\\n_Vikzhel._ The \
Union of Railway Workers insisted that some agreement\\nbe reached to halt \
the civil war, and demanded that Kerensky treat\\nwith the Bolsheviki, and \
that he stop the advance on Petrograd. In\\ncase of refusal, the _Vikzhel_ \
threatened a general strike at\\nmidnight of November 11th.\\n\\nKerensky \
asked to be allowed to discuss the matter with the Socialist\\nMinisters and \
with the Committee for Salvation. He was plainly\\nundecided.\\n\\nOn the \
11th Cossack outposts reached Krasnoye Selo, from which the\\nlocal Soviet \
and the heterogeneous forces of the Military\\nRevolutionary Committee \
precipitately retired, some of them\\nsurrendering.... That night they also \
touched Pulkovo, where the first\\nreal resistance was \
encountered....\\n\\nCossacks deserters began to dribble into Petrograd, \
declaring that\\nKerensky had lied to them, that he had spread broadcast over \
the\\nfront proclamations which said that Petrograd was burning, that \
the\\nBolsheviki had invited the Germans to come in, and that they \
were\\nmurdering women and children and looting indiscriminately....\\n\\nThe \
Military Revolutionary Committee immediately sent out some dozens\\nof \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]agitators,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] with thousands of \
printed appeals, to inform the\\nCossacks of the real \
situation....\\n\\n2.\\n\\nPROCLAMATIONS OF THE MILITARY REVOLUTIONARY \
COMMITTEE\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To All Soviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The All-Russian Congress of Soviets of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies charges the local Soviets immediately to take the\
\\nmost energetic measures to oppose all counter-revolutionary\\nanti-Semitic \
disturbances, and all _pogroms_ of whatever nature. The\\nhonour of the \
workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] and soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution cannot\\ntolerate any disorders....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Red Guard of Petrograd, the revolutionary garrison \
and the\\nsailors have maintained complete order in the capital.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Workers, soldiers, and peasants, everywhere you should \
follow the\\nexample of the workers and soldiers of Petrograd.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades soldiers and Cossacks, on us falls the duty \
of keeping real\\nrevolutionary order.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All \
revolutionary Russia and the whole world have their eyes on\\nyou....\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The All-Russian Congress \
of Soviets decrees:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]To abolish capital punishment \
at the Front, which was reintroduced\\nby Kerensky.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Complete freedom of propaganda is to be re-established \
in the\\ncountry. All soldiers and revolutionary officers now under arrest \
for\\nso-called political \[OpenCurlyQuote]crimes\[CloseCurlyQuote] are at \
once to be set free.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
ex-Premier Kerensky, overthrown by the people, refuses to submit\\nto the \
Congress of Soviets and attempts to struggle against the legal\\nGovernment \
elected by the All-Russian Congress--the Council \
of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars. The Front has refused to aid \
Kerensky. Moscow\\nhas rallied to the new Government. In many cities (Minsk, \
Moghilev,\\nKharkov) the power is in the hands of the Soviets. No \
infantry\\ndetachment consents to march against the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nGovernment, which, in accord with the firm \
will of the Army and the\\npeople, has begun peace negotiations and has given \
the land to the\\npeasants....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We give public \
warning that if the Cossacks do not halt Kerensky,\\nwho has deceived them \
and is leading them against Petrograd, the\\nrevolutionary forces will rise \
with all their might for the defence\\nof the precious conquests of the \
Revolution--Peace and Land.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Citizens of \
Petrograd! Kerensky fled from the city, abandoning the\\nauthority to \
Kishkin, who wanted to surrender the capital to the\\nGermans; Rutenburg, of \
the Black Band, who sabotaged the Municipal\\nFood Supply; and Paltchinsky, \
hated by the whole democracy. Kerensky\\nhas fled, abandoning you to the \
Germans, to famine, to bloody\\nmassacres. The revolting people have arrested \
Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Ministers,\\nand you have seen how the order and \
supplying of Petrograd at once\\nimproved. Kerensky, at the demand of the \
aristocrat proprietors, the\\ncapitalists, speculators, marches against you \
for the purpose of\\ngiving back the land to the land-owners, and continuing \
the hated and\\nruinous war.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Citizens of \
Petrograd! We know that the great majority of you are in\\nfavour of the \
people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s revolutionary authority, against the\\nKornilovtsi \
led by Kerensky. Do not be deceived by the lying\\ndeclarations of the \
impotent bourgeois conspirators, who will be\\npitilessly crushed.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Workers, soldiers, peasants! We call upon you for \
revolutionary\\ndevotion and discipline.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Millions \
of peasants and soldiers are with us.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The victory \
of the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Revolution is assured!\

decrees as are in my opinion\\npertinent to the Bolshevik conquest of power. \
The rest belong to a\\ndetailed account of the Structure of the Soviet State, \
for which I\\nhave no place in this work. This will be dealt with very fully \
in the\\nsecond volume, now in preparation, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov \

Dwelling-Places_\\n\\n1. The independent Municipal Self-Governments have the \
right to\\nsequestrate all unoccupied or uninhabited dwelling-places.\\n\\n2. \
The Municipalities may, according to laws and arrangements\\nestablished by \
them, install in all available lodgings citizens who\\nhave no place to live, \
or who live in congested or unhealthy lodgings.\\n\\n3. The Municipalities \
may establish a service of inspection of\\ndwelling-places, organise it and \
define its powers.\\n\\n4. The Municipalities may issue orders on the \
institution of House\\nCommittees, define their organisation, their powers \
and give them\\njuridical authority.\\n\\n5. The Municipalities may create \
Housing Tribunals, define their\\npowers and their authority.\\n\\n6. This \

*\\n\\n_On Social Insurance_\\n\\nThe Russian proletariat has inscribed on \
its banners the promise of\\ncomplete Social Insurance of wage-workers, as \
well as of the town and\\nvillage poor. The Government of the Tsar, the \
proprietors and the\\ncapitalists, as well as the Government of coalition and \
conciliation,\\nfailed to realise the desires of the workers with regard to \
Social\\nInsurance.\\n\\nThe Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government, relying upon the support of\\nthe Soviets of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, announces\\nto the working-class of Russia and \
to the town and village poor, that\\nit will immediately prepare laws on \
Social Insurance based on the\\nformulas proposed by the Labour \
organisations:\\n\\n1. Insurance for all wage-workers without exception, as \
well as for\\nall urban and rural poor.\\n\\n2. Insurance to cover all \
categories of loss of working capacity,\\nsuch as illness, infirmities, old \
age, childbirth, widowhood,\\norphanage, and unemployment.\\n\\n3. All the \
costs of insurance to be charged to employers.\\n\\n4. Compensation of at \
least full wages in all loss of working\\ncapacity and unemployment.\\n\\n5. \
Complete workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] self-government of all Insurance \
institutions.\\n\\nIn the name of the Government of the Russian Republic,\\n  \

Popular Education_\\n\\nCitizens of Russia!\\n\\nWith the insurrection of \
November 7th the working masses have won for\\nthe first time the real power.\
\\n\\nThe All-Russian Congress of Soviets has temporarily transferred \
this\\npower both to its Executive Committee and to the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars.\\n\\nBy the will of the revolutionary \
people, I have been appointed\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar of \
Education.\\n\\nThe work of guiding in general the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
education, inasmuch as it\\nremains with the central government, is, until \
the Constituent\\nAssembly meets, entrusted to a Commission on the People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Education,\\nwhose chairman and executive is the People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar.\\n\\nUpon what fundamental propositions will \
rest this State Commission?\\nHow is its sphere of competence \
determined?\\n\\n_The General Line of Educational Activity:_ Every \
genuinely\\ndemocratic power must, in the domain of education, in a country \
where\\nilliteracy and ignorance reign supreme, make its first aim \
the\\nstruggle against this darkness. It must acquire in the shortest \
time\\n_universal literacy,_ by organising a network of schools answering \
to\\nthe demands of modern pedagogics; it must introduce \
universal,\\nobligatory and free tuition for all, and establish at the same \
time a\\nseries of such teachers\[CloseCurlyQuote] institutes and seminaries \
as will in the\\nshortest time furnish a powerful army of people\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s teachers so\\nnecessary for the universal instruction of \
the population of our\\nboundless Russia.\\n\\n_Decentralisation:_ The State \
Commission on People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Education is by\\nno means a central \
power governing the institutions of instruction\\nand education. On the \
contrary, the entire school work ought to be\\ntransferred to the organs of \
local self-government. The independent\\nwork of the workers, soldiers and \
peasants, establishing on their own\\ninitiative cultural educational \
organisations, must be given full\\nautonomy, both by the State centre and \
the Municipal centres.\\n\\nThe work of the State Commission serves as a link \
and helpmate to\\norganise resources of material and moral support to the \
Municipal and\\nprivate institutions, particularly to those with a \
class-character\\nestablished by the workers.\\n\\n_The State Committee on \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Education:_ A whole series of\\ninvaluable law \
projects was elaborated from the beginning of the\\nRevolution by the State \
Committee for People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Education, a tolerably\\ndemocratic \
body as to its composition, and rich in experts. The State\\nCommission \
sincerely desires the collaboration of this Committee.\\n\\nIt has addressed \
itself to the bureau of the Committee, with the\\nrequest at once to convoke \
an extraordinary session of the Committee\\nfor the fulfilment of the \
following programme:\\n\\n1. The revision of rules of representation in the \
Committee, in the\\nsense of greater democratisation.\\n\\n2. The revision of \
the Committee\[CloseCurlyQuote]s rights in the sense of widening\\nthem, and \
of converting the Committee into a fundamental State\\ninstitute for the \
elaboration of law projects calculated to\\nreorganise public instruction and \
education in Russia upon democratic\\nprinciples.\\n\\n3. The revision, \
jointly with the new State Commission, of the laws\\nalready created by the \
Committee, a revision required by the fact\\nthat in editing them the \
Committee had to take into account the\\nbourgeois spirit of previous \
Ministries, which obstructed it even in\\nthis its narrowed form.\\n\\nAfter \
this revision these laws will be put into effect without any\\nbureaucratic \
red tape, in the revolutionary order.\\n\\n_The Pedagogues and the \
Societists:_ The State Commission welcomes\\nthe pedagogues to the bright and \
honourable work of educating the\\npeople--the masters of the \
country.\\n\\nNo one measure in the domain of the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
education ought to be\\nadopted by any power without the attentive \
deliberation of those who\\nrepresent the pedagogues.\\n\\nOn the other hand, \
a decision cannot by any means be reached\\nexclusively through the \
cooperation of specialists. This refers as\\nwell to reforms of the \
institutes of general education.\\n\\nThe cooperation of the pedagogues with \
the social forces--this is how\\nthe Commission will work both in its own \
constitution, in the State\\nCommittee, and in all its activities.\\n\\nAs \
its first task the Commission considers the improvement of the\\nteachers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] status, and first of all of those very poor though \
almost\\nmost important contributors to the work of culture--the \
elementary\\nschool teachers. Their just demands ought to be satisfied at \
once and\\nat any cost. The proletariat of the schools has in vain demanded \
an\\nincrease of salary to one hundred rubles per month. It would be \
a\\ndisgrace any longer to keep in poverty the teachers of the\\noverwhelming \
majority of the Russian people.\\n\\nBut a real democracy cannot stop at mere \
literacy, at universal\\nelementary instruction. It must endeavour to \
organise a uniform\\nsecular school of several grades. The ideal is, equal \
and if possible\\nhigher education for all the citizens. So long as this idea \
has not\\nbeen realised for all, the natural transition through all \
the\\nschooling grades up to the university--a transition to a \
higher\\nstage--must depend entirely upon the pupil\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
aptitude, and not upon\\nthe resources of his family.\\n\\nThe problem of a \
genuinely democratic organisation of instruction is\\nparticularly difficult \
in a country impoverished by a long, criminal,\\nimperialistic war; but the \
workers who have taken the power must\\nremember that education will serve \
them as the greatest instrument in\\ntheir struggle for a better lot and for \
a spiritual growth. However\\nneedful it may be to curtail other articles of \
the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s budget,\\nthe expenses on education must stand \
high. A large educational budget\\nis the pride and glory of a nation. The \
free and enfranchised peoples\\nof Russia will not forget this.\\n\\nThe \
fight against illiteracy and ignorance cannot be confined to a\\nthorough \
establishment of school education for children and youths.\\nAdults, too, \
will be anxious to save themselves from the debasing\\nposition of a man who \
cannot read and write. The school for adults\\nmust occupy a conspicuous \
place in the general plan of popular\\ninstruction.\\n\\n_Instruction and \
Education:_ One must emphasise the difference\\nbetween instruction and \
education.\\n\\nInstruction is the transmission of ready knowledge by the \
teacher to\\nhis pupil. Education is a creative process. The personality of \
the\\nindividual is being \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]educated\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] throughout life, is being formed,\\ngrows richer in \
content, stronger and more perfect.\\n\\nThe toiling masses of the \
people--the workmen, the peasants, the\\nsoldiers--are thirsting for \
elementary and advanced instruction. But\\nthey are also thirsting for \
education. Neither the government nor the\\nintellectuals nor any other power \
outside of themselves can give it\\nto them. The school, the book, the \
theatre, the museum, etc., may\\nhere by only aids. They have their own \
ideas, formed by their social\\nposition, so different from the position of \
those ruling classes and\\nintellectuals who have hitherto created culture. \
They have their own\\nideas, their own emotions, their own ways of \
approaching the problems\\nof personality and society. The city labourer, \
according to his own\\nfashion, the rural toiler according to his, will each \
build his clear\\nworld-conception permeated with the class-idea of the \
workers. There\\nis no more superb or beautiful phenomenon than the one of \
which our\\nnearest descendants will be both witnesses and participants: \
The\\nbuilding by collective Labour of its own general, rich and free \
soul.\\n\\nInstruction will surely be an important but not a decisive \
element.\\nWhat is more important here is the criticism, the creativeness of \
the\\nmasses themselves; for science and art have only in some of \
their\\nparts a general human importance. They suffer radical changes \
with\\nevery far-reaching class upheaval.\\n\\nThroughout Russia, \
particularly among the city labourers, but also\\namong the peasants, a \
powerful wave of cultural educational movement\\nhas arisen; workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] organisations of this kind \
are\\nmultiplying rapidly. To meet them, to lend them support, to clear \
the\\nroad before them is the first task of a revolutionary and \
popular\\ngovernment in the domain of democratic education.\\n\\n_The \
Constituent Assembly_ will doubtless soon begin its work. It\\nalone can \
permanently establish the order of national and social life\\nin our country, \
and at the same time the general character of the\\norganisation of popular \
education.\\n\\nNow, however, with the passage of power to the Soviets, the \
really\\ndemocratic character of the Constituent Assembly is assured. The \
line\\nwhich the State Commission, relying upon the State Committee, \
will\\nfollow, will hardly suffer any modification under the influence \
of\\nthe Constituent Assembly. Without pre-determining it, the new\\nPeople\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Government considers itself within its rights in enacting \
in\\nthis domain a series of measures which aim at enriching \
and\\nenlightening as soon as possible the spiritual life of the \
country.\\n\\n_The Ministry:_ The present work must in the interim proceed \
through\\nthe Ministry of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Education. Of all the \
necessary\\nalterations in its composition and construction the State \
Commission\\nwill have charge, elected by the Executive Committee of the \
Soviets\\nand the State Committee. Of course the order of State authority \
in\\nthe domain of the people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s education will be \
established by the\\nConstituent Assembly. Until then, the Ministry must play \
the part of\\nthe executive apparatus for both the State Committee and the \
State\\nCommission for People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Education.\\n\\nThe pledge \
of the country\[CloseCurlyQuote]s safety lies in the cooperation of all \
its\\nvital and genuinely democratic forces.\\n\\nWe believe that the \
energetic effort of the working people and of the\\nhonest enlightened \
intellectuals will lead the country out of its\\npainful crisis, and through \
complete democracy to the reign of\\nSocialism and the brotherhood of \
nations.\\n\\n      _People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar on Education,_\\n\\n \

  *     *\\n\\n_On the Order in Which the Laws Are to be Ratified and \
Published._\\n\\n1. Until the convocation of the Constituent Assembly, the \
enacting\\nand publishing of laws shall be carried out in the order decreed \
by\\nthe present Provisional Workmen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government, elected\\nby the All-Russian Congress of \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies.\\n\\n2. Every bill is presented for \
consideration of the Government by the\\nrespective Ministry, signed by the \
duly authorised People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissar; or it is presented by \
the legislative section attached to\\nthe Government, signed by the chief of \
the section.\\n\\n3. After its ratification by the Government, the decree in \
its final\\nedition, in the name of the Russian Republic, is signed by \
the\\npresident of the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars, or \
for him by the\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar who presented it for the \
consideration of the\\nGovernment, and is then published.\\n\\n4. The date of \
publishing it in the official \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Gazette of \
the\\nProvisional Workmen\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Government,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] is the date of its\\nbecoming \
law.\\n\\n5. In the decree there may be appointed a date, other than the date\
\\nof publication, on which it shall become law, or it may be\\npromulgated \
by telegraph; in which case it is to be regarded in every\\nlocality as \
becoming law upon the publication of the telegram.\\n\\n6. The promulgation \
of legislative acts of the government by the\\nState Senate is abolished. The \
Legislative Section attached to the\\nCouncil of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars issues periodically a collection of\\nregulations and orders of \
the government which possess the force of\\nlaw.\\n\\n7. The Central \

REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE. BULLETIN NO. 2\\n\\nNovember 12th, in the evening, \
Kerensky sent a proposition to the\\nrevolutionary troops--\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]to lay down their arms.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s men opened\\nartillery fire. Our artillery \
answered and compelled the enemy to be\\nsilent. The Cossacks assumed the \
offensive. The deadly fire of the\\nsailors, the Red Guards and the soldiers \
forced the Cossacks to\\nretreat. Our armoured cars rushed in among the ranks \
of the enemy.\\nThe enemy is fleeing. Our troops are in pursuit. The order \
has been\\ngiven to arrest Kerensky. Tsarskoye Selo has been taken by \
the\\nrevolutionary troops.\\n\\n_The Lettish Riflemen:_ The Military \
Revolutionary Committee has\\nreceived precise information that the valiant \
Lettish Riflemen have\\narrived from the Front and taken up a position in the \
rear of\\nKerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s bands.\\n\\n_From the Staff of the \
Military Revolutionary Committee_\\n\\nThe seizure of Gatchina and Tsarskoye \
Selo by Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s detachments\\nis to be explained by the \
complete absence of artillery and\\nmachine-guns in these places, whereas \
Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s cavalry was provided\\nwith artillery from the \
beginning. The last two days were days of\\nenforced work for our Staff, to \
provide the necessary quantity of\\nguns, machine-guns, field telephones, \
etc., for the revolutionary\\ntroops. When this work--with the energetic \
assistance of the District\\nSoviets and the factories (the Putilov Works, \
Obukhov and others)--was\\naccomplished, the issue of the expected encounter \
left no place for\\ndoubt: on the side of the revolutionary troops there was \
not only a\\nsurplus in quantity and such a powerful material base as \
Petrograd,\\nbut also an enormous moral advantage. All the Petrograd \
regiments\\nmoved out to the positions with tremendous enthusiasm. The \
Garrison\\nConference elected a Control Commission of five soldiers, \
thus\\nsecuring a complete unity between the commander in chief and \
the\\ngarrison. At the Garrison Conference it was unanimously decided \
to\\nbegin decisive action.\\n\\nThe artillery fire on the 12th of November \
developed with\\nextraordinary force by 3 P.M. The Cossacks were \
completely\\ndemoralised. A parliamentarian came from them to the staff of \
the\\ndetachment at Krasnoye Selo, and proposed to stop the \
firing,\\nthreatening otherwise to take \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]decisive\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] measures. He was answered\\nthat the firing would \
cease when Kerensky laid down his arms.\\n\\nIn the developing encounter all \
sections of the troops--the sailors,\\nsoldiers and the Red Guards--showed \
unlimited courage. The sailors\\ncontinued to advance until they had fired \
all their cartridges. The\\nnumber of casualties has not been established \
yet, but it is larger\\non the part of the counter-revolutionary troops, who \
experienced\\ngreat losses through one of our armoured cars.\\n\\nKerensky\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s staff, fearing that they would be surrounded, gave \
the\\norder to retreat, which retreat speedily assumed a \
disorderly\\ncharacter. By 11-12 P.M., Tsarkoye Selo, including the \
wireless\\nstation, was entirely occupied by the troops of the Soviets. \
The\\nCossacks retreated towards Gatchina and Colpinno.\\n\\nThe morale of \
the troops is beyond all praise. The order has been\\ngiven to pursue the \
retreating Cossacks. From the Tsarskoye Selo\\nstation a radio-telegram was \
sent immediately to the Front and to all\\nlocal Soviets throughout Russia. \
Further details will be\\ncommunicated....\\n\\n2.\\n\\nEVENTS OF THE 13TH IN \
PETROGRAD\\n\\nThree regiments of the Petrograd garrison to take any part in \
the\\nbattle against Kerensky. On the morning of the 13th they summoned \
to\\na joint conference sixty delegates from the Front, in order to \
find\\nsome way to stop the civil war. This conference appointed a \
committee\\nto go and persuade Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s troops to lay down \
their arms. They\\nproposed to ask the Government soldiers the following \
questions: (1)\\nWill the soldiers and Cossacks of Kerensky recognise \
the\\n_Tsay-ee-kah_ as the repository of Governmental power, responsible \
to\\nthe Congress of Soviets? (2) Will the soldiers and Cossacks accept\\nthe \
decrees of the second Congress of Soviets? (3) Will they accept\\nthe Land \
and Peace decrees? (4) Will they agree to cease hostilities\\nand return to \
their units? (5) Will they consent to the arrest of\\nKerensky, Krasnov and \
Savinkov?\\n\\nAt the meeting of the Petrograd Soviet, Zinoviev said, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It would be\\nfoolish to think that this committee \
could finish affair. The enemy\\ncan only be broken by force. However, it \
would be a crime for us not\\nto try every peaceful means to bring the \
Cossacks over to us.... What\\nwe need is a military victory.... The news of \
an armistice is\\npremature. Our Staff will be ready to conclude an armistice \
when the\\nenemy can no longer do any harm....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At \
present, the influence of our victory is creating new \
political\\nconditions.... To-day the Socialist Revolutionaries are \
inclined\\nto admit the Bolsheviki into the new Government.... A \
decisive\\nvictory is indispensable, so that those who hesitate will have \
no\\nfurther hesitation....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAt the City Duma all \
attention was concentrated on the formation of\\nthe new Government. In many \
factories and barracks already\\nRevolutionary Tribunals were operating, and \
the Bolsheviki were\\nthreatening to set up more of these, and try Gotz and \
Avksentiev\\nbefore them. Dan proposed that an ultimatum be sent demanding \
the\\nabolition of these Revolutionary Tribunals, or the other members \
of\\nthe Conference would immediately break off all negotiations with \
the\\nBolsheviki.\\n\\nShingariov, Cadet, declared that the Municipality \
ought not to take\\npart in any agreement with the Bolsheviki.... \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Any agreement with the\\nmaniacs is impossible until \
they lay down their arms and recognise\\nthe authority of independent courts \
of law....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nYartsev, for the _Yedinstvo_ group, \
declared that any agreement with\\nthe Bolsheviki would be equivalent to a \
Bolshevik victory....\\n\\nMayor Schreider, for the Socialist \
Revolutionaries, stated that he\\nwas opposed to all agreement with the \
Bolsheviki.... \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]As for a\\nGovernment, that ought to \
spring from the popular will; and since the\\npopular will has been expressed \
in the municipal elections, the\\npopular will which can create a Government \
is actually concentrated\\nin the Duma....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nAfter \
other speakers, of which only the representative of the\\nMensheviki \
Internationalists was in favour of considering the\\nadmission of the \
Bolsheviki into the new Government, the Duma voted\\nto continue its \
representatives in the _Vikzhel\[CloseCurlyQuote]s_ conference, but \
to\\ninsist upon the restoration of the Provisional Government \
before\\neverything, and to exclude the Bolsheviki from the new \
power....\\n\\n3.\\n\\nTRUCE. KRASNOV\[CloseCurlyQuote]s ANSWER TO THE \
COMMITTEE FOR SALVATION\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In answer to your \
telegram proposing an immediate armistice, the\\nSupreme Commander, not \
wishing further futile bloodshed, consents to\\nenter into negotiations and \
to establish relations between the armies\\nof the Government and the \
insurrectionists. He proposes to the\\nGeneral Staff of the insurrectionists \
to recall its regiments to\\nPetrograd, to declare the line \
Ligovo-Pulkovo-Colpinno neutral, and\\nto allow the advance-guards of the \
Government cavalry to enter\\nTsarskoye Selo, for the purpose of establishing \
order. The answer to\\nthis proposal must be placed in the hands of our \
envoys before eight\\no\[CloseCurlyQuote]clock to-morrow \
morning.\\n\\nKRASNOV.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n4.\\n\\nEVENTS AT \
TSARSKOYE SELO\\n\\nOn the evening that Kerensky\[CloseCurlyQuote]s troops \
retreated from Tsarskoye Selo,\\nsome priests organised a religious \
procession through the streets of\\nthe town, making speeches to the citizens \
in which they asked the\\npeople to support the rightful authority, the \
Provisional Government.\\nWhen the Cossacks had retreated, and the first Red \
Guards entered the\\ntown, witnesses reported that the priests had incited \
the people\\nagainst the Soviets, and had said prayers at the grave of \
Rasputin,\\nwhich lies behind the Imperial Palace. One of the priests, Father\
\\nIvan Kutchurov, was arrested and shot by the infuriated Red \
Guards....\\n\\nJust as the Red Guards entered the town the electric lights \
were shut\\noff, plunging the streets in complete darkness. The director of \
the\\nelectric light plant, Lubovitch, was arrested by the Soviet \
troops\\nand asked why he had shut off the lights. He was found some \
time\\nlater in the room where he had been imprisoned with a revolver in \
his\\nhand and a bullet hole in his temple.\\n\\nThe Petrograd anti-Bolshevik \
papers came out next day with headlines,\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Plekhanov\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s temperature 39 degrees!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] Plekhanov \
lived at Tsarskoye\\nSelo, where he was lying ill in bed. Red Guards arrived \
at the house\\nand searched it for arms, questioning the old man.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]What class of society do you belong to?\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] they asked him.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]I am a \
revolutionist,\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] answered Plekhanov, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]who for forty years has\\ndevoted his life to the \
struggle for \
liberty!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Anyway,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] said a workman, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]you have now \
sold yourself to the\\nbourgeoisie!\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nThe workers \
no longer knew Plekhanov, pioneer of the Russian \
Social\\nDemocracy!\\n\\n5.\\n\\nAPPEAL OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The detachments at Gatchina, deceived by Kerensky, \
have laid down\\ntheir arms and decided to arrest Kerensky. That chief of the\
\\ncounter-revolutionary campaign has fled. The Army, by an \
enormous\\nmajority, has pronounced in favour of the second All-Russian \
Congress\\nof Soviets, and of the Government which it has created. Scores \
of\\ndelegates from the Front have hastened to Petrograd to assure \
the\\nSoviet Government of the Army\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fidelity. No twisting \
of the facts,\\nno calumny against the revolutionary workers, soldiers, and \
peasants,\\nhas been able to defeat the People. The Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
and Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nRevolution is victorious....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The _Tsay-ee-kah_ appeals to the troops which march \
under the flag\\nof the counter-revolution, and invites them immediately to \
lay down\\ntheir arms--to shed no longer the blood of their brothers in \
the\\ninterests of a handful of land-owners and capitalists. The Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote],\\nSoldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution curses those who remain even for a\\nmoment \
under the flag of the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s enemies....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Cossacks! Come over to the rank of the victorious \

CHAPTER X\\n\\n1.\\n\\nDAMAGE TO THE KREMLIN\\n\\nI myself verified the \
damage to the Kremlin, which I visited\\nimmediately after the bombardment. \
The Little Nicolai Palace, a\\nbuilding of no particular importance, which \
was occupied occasionally\\nby receptions of one of the Grand Duchesses, had \
served as barracks\\nfor the _yunkers._ It was not only bombarded, but pretty \
well sacked;\\nfortunately there was nothing in it of particular historical \
value.\\n\\nUsspensky Cathedral had a shell-hole in one of the cupolas, \
but\\nexcept for a few feet of mosaic in the ceiling, was undamaged. \
The\\nfrescoes on the porch of Blagovestchensky Cathedral were \
badly\\ndamaged by a shell. Another shell hit the corner of Ivan \
Veliki.\\nTchudovsky Monastery was hit about thirty times, but only one shell\
\\nwent through a window into the interior, the others breaking the\\nbrick \
window-moulding and the roof cornices.\\n\\nThe clock over the Spasskaya Gate \
was smashed. Troitsky Gate was\\nbattered, but easily reparable. One of the \
lower towers had lost its\\nbrick spire.\\n\\nThe church of St. Basil was \
untouched, as was the great Imperial\\nPalace, with all the treasures of \
Moscow and Petrograd in its cellar,\\nand the crown jewels in the Treasury. \
These places were not even\\nentered.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nLUNATCHARSKY\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s DECLARATION\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! You are \
the young masters of the country, and although now\\nyou have much to do and \
think about, you must know how to defend your\\nartistic and scientific \
treasures.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! That which is happening at \
Moscow is a horrible,\\nirreparable misfortune.... The People in its struggle \
for the power has\\nmutilated our glorious capital.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is particularly terrible in these days of violent \
struggle, of\\ndestructive warfare, to be Commissar of Public Education. Only \
the\\nhope of the victory of Socialism, the source of a new and \
superior\\nculture, brings me comfort. On me weighs the responsibility \
of\\nprotecting the artistic wealth of the people.... Not being able \
to\\nremain at my post, where I had no influence, I resigned. My \
comrades,\\nthe other Commissars, considered this resignation inadmissible. I\
\\nshall therefore remain at my post.... And moreover, I understand \
that\\nthe damage done to the Kremlin is not as serious as has \
been\\nreported....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]But I beg you, comrades, to \
give me your support.... Preserve for\\nyourselves and your descendants the \
beauty of our land; be the\\nguardians of the property of the People.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Soon, very soon, even the most ignorant, who have been \
held in\\nignorance so long, will awake and understand what a source of \
joy,\\nstrength and wisdom is \

SHEVERDIN-MAKSIMENKO.\\n\\n\\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XI\\n\\n1.\\n\\nLIMITATIONS \
OF THIS CHAPTER\\n\\nThis chapter extends over a period of two months, more \
or less. It\\ncovers the time of negotiations with the Allies, the \
negotiations and\\narmistice with the Germans, and the beginning of the Peace\
\\nnegotiations at Brest-Litovsk, as well as the period in which were\\nlaid \
the foundations of the Soviet State.\\n\\nHowever, it is no part of my \
purpose in this book to describe and\\ninterpret these very important \
historical events, which require more\\nspace. They are therefore reserved \
for another volume, \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov to\\nBrest-Litovsk.\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIn this chapter, then, I have confined myself \
to the Soviet\\nGovernment\[CloseCurlyQuote]s attempts to consolidate its \
political power at home, and\\nsketched its successive conquests of hostile \
domestic elements--which\\nprocess was temporarily interrupted by the \
disastrous Peace of\\nBrest-Litovsk.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nPREAMBLE--DECLARATION OF \
THE RIGHTS OF THE PEOPLES OF RUSSIA\\n\\nThe October Revolution of the \
workers and peasants began under the\\ncommon banner of \
Emancipation.\\n\\nThe peasants are being emancipated from the power of the \
landowners,\\nfor there is no longer the landowner\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
property right in the land--it\\nhas been abolished. The soldiers and sailors \
are being emancipated\\nfrom the power of autocratic generals, for generals \
will henceforth\\nbe elective and subject to recall. The workingmen are being\
\\nemancipated from the whims and arbitrary will of the capitalists, \
for\\nhenceforth there will be established the control of the workers \
over\\nmills and factories. Everything living and capable of life is \
being\\nemancipated from the hateful shackles.\\n\\nThere remain only the \
peoples of Russia, who have suffered and are\\nsuffering oppression and \
arbitrariness, and whose emancipation must\\nimmediately be begun, whose \
liberation must be effected resolutely\\nand definitely.\\n\\nDuring the \
period of Tsarism the peoples of Russia were\\nsystematically incited against \
one another. The result of such a\\npolicy are known: massacres and _pogroms_ \
on the one hand, slavery of\\npeoples on the other.\\n\\nThere can be and \
there must be no return to this disgraceful policy.\\nHenceforth the policy \
of a voluntary and honest union of the peoples\\nof Russia must be \
substituted.\\n\\nIn the period of imperialism, after the March revolution, \
when the\\npower was transferred into the hands of the Cadet bourgeoisie, the\
\\nnaked policy of provocation gave way to one of cowardly distrust of\\nthe \
peoples of Russia, to a policy of fault-finding, of meaningless\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]freedom\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] and \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]equality\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of peoples. The \
results of such a policy are\\nknown: the growth of national enmity, the \
impairment of mutual\\nconfidence.\\n\\nAn end must be put to this unworthy \
policy of falsehood and distrust,\\nof fault-finding and provocation. \
Henceforth it must be replaced by\\nan open and honest policy leading to the \
complete mutual confidence\\nof the peoples of Russia. Only as the result of \
such a trust can\\nthere be formed an honest and lasting union of the peoples \
of Russia.\\nOnly as the result of such a union can the workers and peasants \
of\\nthe peoples of Russia be cemented into one revolutionary force able\\nto \
resist all attempts on the part of the \
imperialist-annexationist\\nbourgeoisie.\\n\\n3.\\n\\nDECREES\\n\\n_On the \
Nationalisation of the Banks_\\n\\nIn the interest of the regular \
organisation of the national economy,\\nof the thorough eradication of bank \
speculation and the complete\\nemancipation of the workers, peasants, and the \
whole labouring\\npopulation from the exploitation of banking capital, and \
with a view\\nto the establishment of a single national bank of the \
Russian\\nRepublic which shall serve the real interests of the people and the\
\\npoorer classes, the Central Executive Committee \
_(Tsay-ee-kah)_\\nresolves:\\n\\n1. The banking business is declared a state \
monopoly.\\n\\n2. All existing private joint-stock banks and banking offices \
are\\nmerged in the State Bank.\\n\\n3. The assets and liabilities of the \
liquidated establishments are\\ntaken over by the State Bank.\\n\\n4. The \
order of the merger of private banks in the State Bank is to\\nbe determined \
by a special decree.\\n\\n5. The temporary administration of the affairs of \
the private banks\\nis entrusted to the board of the State Bank.\\n\\n6. The \
interests of the small depositors will be safeguarded.\\n\\n                  \

\\nIn realisation of the will of the revolutionary people regarding \
the\\nprompt and decisive abolition of all remnants of former inequality \
in\\nthe Army, the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars \
decrees:\\n\\n1. All ranks and grades in the Army, beginning with the rank of\
\\nCorporal and ending with the rank of General, are abolished. The Army\\nof \
the Russian Republic consists now of free and equal citizens,\\nbearing the \
honourable title of Soldiers of the Revolutionary Army.\\n\\n2. All \
privileges connected with the former ranks and grades, also\\nall outward \
marks of distinction, are abolished.\\n\\n3. All addressing by titles is \
abolished.\\n\\n4. All decorations, orders, and other marks of distinction \
are\\nabolished.\\n\\n5. With the abolition of the rank of officer, all \
separate officers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\norganisations are \
abolished.\\n\\nNote.--Orderlies are left only for headquarters, \
chanceries,\\nCommittees and other Army organisations.\\n\\n      _President \

Elective Principle and the Organisation of Authority in the\\nArmy_\\n\\n1. \
The army serving the will of the toiling people is subject to its\\nsupreme \
representative--the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\\n2. \
Full authority within the limits of military units and\\ncombinations is \
vested in the respective Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Committees and\\nSoviets.\
\\n\\n3. Those phases of the life and activity of the troops which \
are\\nalready under the jurisdiction of the Committees are now \
formally\\nplaced in their direct control. Over such branches of activity \
which\\nthe Committees cannot assume, the control of the Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets is\\nestablished.\\n\\n4. The election of \
commanding Staff and officers is introduced. All\\ncommanders up to the \
commanders of regiments, inclusive, are elected\\nby general suffrage of \
squads, platoons, companies, squadrons,\\nbatteries, divisions (artillery, \
2-3 batteries), and regiments. All\\ncommanders higher than the commander of \
a regiment, and up to the\\nSupreme Commander, inclusive, are elected by \
congresses or\\nconferences of Committees.\\n\\nNote.--By the term \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]conference\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] must be understood \
a meeting of the\\nrespective Committees together with delegates of \
committees one\\ndegree lower in rank. (Such as a \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]conference\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] of \
Regimental\\nCommittees with delegates from Company \
Committees.--Author.)\\n\\n5. The elected commanders above the rank of \
commander of regiment\\nmust be confirmed by the nearest Supreme \
Committee.\\n\\nNote. In the event of a refusal by a Supreme Committee to \
confirm an\\nelected commander, with a statement of reasons for such refusal, \
a\\ncommander elected by the lower Committee a second time must \
be\\nconfirmed.\\n\\n6. The commanders of Armies are elected by Army \
congresses.\\nCommanders of Fronts are elected by congresses of the \
respective\\nFronts.\\n\\n7. To posts of a technical character, demanding \
special knowledge or\\nother practical preparation, namely: doctors, \
engineers, technicians,\\ntelegraph and wireless operators, aviators, \
automobilists, etc.,\\nonly such persons as possess the required special \
knowledge may be\\nelected, by the Committees of the units of the respective \
services.\\n\\n8. Chiefs of Staff must be chosen from among persons with \
special\\nmilitary training for that post.\\n\\n9. All other members of the \
Staff are appointed by the Chief of\\nStaff, and confirmed by the respective \
congresses.\\n\\nNote.--All persons with special training must be listed in a \
special\\nlist.\\n\\n10. The right is reserved to retire from the service all \
commanders\\non active service who are not elected by the soldiers to any \
post,\\nand who consequently are ranked as privates.\\n\\n11. All other \
functions beside those pertaining to the command, with\\nthe exception of \
posts in the economic departments, are filled by\\nappointment of the \
respective elected commanders.\\n\\n12. Detailed instructions regarding the \
elections of the commanding\\nStaff will be published separately.\\n\\n      \

Council fixed the salary of a People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissar\\nat 500 \
rubles per month, with 100 rubles additional for each grown\\nmember of the \
family incapable of work....\\n\\nThis was the highest salary paid to any \
Government official....\\n\\n4.\\n\\nCountess Panina was arrested and brought \

\[CapitalEAcute]GIME\\n\\nFrom _Drug Naroda_ (Menshevik), November \
18th:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The story of the \[OpenCurlyQuote]immediate \
peace\[CloseCurlyQuote] of the Bolsheviki reminds us of a\\njoyous \
moving-picture film.... Neratov runs--Trotzky pursues; Neratov\\nclimbs a \
wall, Trotzky too; Neratov dives into the water--Trotzky\\nfollows; Neratov \
climbs onto the roof--Trotzky right behind him;\\nNeratov hides under the \
bed--and Trotzky has him! He has him!\\nNaturally, peace is immediately \
signed....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]All is empty and silent at the \
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The\\ncouriers are respectful, but their faces \
wear a caustic expression....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]How about arresting \
an ambassador and signing an armistice or a\\nPeace Treaty with him? But they \
are strange folk, these ambassadors.\\nThey keep silent just as if they had \
heard nothing. Hola, hola,\\nEngland, France, Germany! We have signed an \
armistice with you! Is it\\npossible that you know nothing about it? \
Nevertheless, it has been\\npublished in all the papers and posted on all the \
walls. On a\\nBolshevik\[CloseCurlyQuote]s word of honour, Peace has been \
signed. We\[CloseCurlyQuote]re not asking\\nmuch of you; you just have to \
write two words....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The ambassadors remain \
silent. The Powers remain silent. All is\\nempty and silent in the office of \
the Minister of Foreign \
Affairs.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Listen,\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] says Robespierre-Trotzky to his assistant \
Marat-Uritzky,\\n\[OpenCurlyQuote]run over to the British Ambassador\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s, tell him we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re proposing\\npeace!\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Go yourself,\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] says Marat-Uritzky. \[OpenCurlyQuote]He\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
not receiving.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]\
Telephone him, then.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]I\[CloseCurlyQuote]ve tried. The receiver\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
off the hook.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]\
Send him a telegram.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]I did.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Well, with what result?\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Marat-Uritzky sighs and does not answer. \
Robespierre-Trotzky spits\\nfuriously into the corner....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Listen, Marat,\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
recommences Trotzky, after a moment. \[OpenCurlyQuote]We must\\nabsolutely \
show that we\[CloseCurlyQuote]re conducting an active foreign policy. \
How\\ncan we do that?\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\
\[OpenCurlyQuote]Launch another decree about arresting Neratov,\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] answers Uritzky,\\nwith a profound air.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Marat, you\[CloseCurlyQuote]re a \
blockhead!\[CloseCurlyQuote] cries Trotzky. All of a sudden he\\narises, \
terrible and majestic, looking at this moment like\\nRobespierre.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]Write, Uritzky!\[CloseCurlyQuote] he \
says with severity. \[OpenCurlyQuote]Write a letter to the\\nBritish \
ambassador, a registered letter with receipt demanded. Write!\\nI also will \
write! The peoples of the world await an immediate \
peace!\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In the enormous and \
empty Ministry of Foreign Affairs are to be\\nheard only the sound of two \
typewriters. With his own hands Trotzky\\nis conducting an active foreign \
policy....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n6.\\n\\nON THE QUESTION OF AN \
AGREEMENT\\n\\nTo the Attention of All Workers and All \
Soldiers.\\n\\nNovember 11th, in the club of the Preobrazhensky Regiment, was \
held\\nan extraordinary meeting of representatives of all the units of \
the\\nPetrograd garrison.\\n\\nThe meeting was called upon the initiative of \
the Preobrazhensky and\\nSemionovsky Regiments, for the discussion of the \
question as to which\\nSocialist parties are for the power of the Soviets, \
which are\\nagainst, which are for the people, which against, and if an \
agreement\\nbetween them is possible.\\n\\nThe representatives of the \
_Tsay-ee-kah,_ of the Municipal Duma, of\\nthe Avksentiev Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets, and of all the political parties\\nfrom the \
Bolsheviki to the Populist Socialists, were invited to \
the\\nmeeting.\\n\\nAfter long deliberation, having heard the declarations of \
all\\nparties and organisations, the meeting by a tremendous majority\\nof \
votes agreed that only the Bolsheviki and the Left \
Socialist\\nRevolutionaries are for the people, and that all the other \
parties\\nare only attempting, under cover of seeking an agreement, to \
deprive\\nthe people of the conquests won in the days of the great Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and\\nPeasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution of \
November.\\n\\nHere is the text of the resolution carried at this meeting of \
the\\nPetrograd garrison, by 61 votes against 11, and 12 not voting:\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The garrison conference, summoned at the initiative of \
the\\nSemionovsky and Preobrazhensky Regiments, on hearing \
the\\nrepresentatives of all the Socialist parties and \
popular\\norganisations on the question of an agreement between the different\
\\npolitical parties finds that:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]1. The \
representatives of the _Tasy-ee-kah,_ the representatives of\\nthe Bolshevik \
party and the Left Socialist Revolutionaries, declared\\ndefinitely that they \
stand for a Government of the Soviets, for the\\ndecrees on Land, Peace and \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control of Industry, and that\\nupon this platform \
they are willing to agree with all the Socialist\\nparties.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]2. At the same time the representatives of the other \
parties\\n(Mensheviki, Socialist Revolutionaries) either gave no answer at \
all,\\nor declared simply that they were opposed to the power of the \
Soviets\\nand against the decrees on Land, Peace and \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In view of \
this the meeting resolves:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]\[OpenCurlyQuote]1. To \
express severe censure of all parties which, under cover of\\nan agreement, \
wish practically to annul the popular conquests of the\\nRevolution of \
November.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]2. To express full confidence in the \
_Tsay-ee-kah_ and the Council\\nof People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars, and \
to promise them complete support.\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]At the same time the meeting deems it necessary that \
the comrades\\nLeft Socialist Revolutionaries should enter the People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Government.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n7.\\n\\nWINE \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]POGROMS\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nIt was afterward \
discovered that there was a regular organisation,\\nmaintained by the Cadets, \
for provoking rioting among the soldiers.\\nThere would be telephone messages \
to the different barracks,\\nannouncing that wine was being given away at \
such and such an\\naddress, and when the soldiers arrived at the spot an \
individual\\nwould point out the location of the cellar....\\n\\nThe Council \
of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars appointed a Commissar for the\\nFight \
Against Drunkenness, who, besides mercilessly putting down the\\nwine riots, \
destroyed hundreds of thousands of bottles of liquor. The\\nWinter Palace \
cellars, containing rare vintages valued at more than\\nfive million dollars, \
were at first flooded, and then the liquor was\\nremoved to Cronstadt and \
destroyed.\\n\\nIn this work the Cronstadt sailors, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]flower and pride of the\\nrevolutionary forces,\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] as Trotzky called them, acquitted themselves\\nwith \
iron self-dicipline....\\n\\n8.\\n\\nSPECULATORS\\n\\nTwo orders concerning \
them:\\n\\n  _Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars_\\n\\n  _To the \
Military Revolutionary Committee_\\n\\nThe disorganisation of the food supply \
created by the war, and the\\nlack of system, is becoming to the last degree \
acute, thanks to the\\nspeculators, marauders and their followers on the \
railways, in the\\nsteamship offices, forwarding offices, etc.\\n\\nTaking \
advantage of the nation\[CloseCurlyQuote]s greatest misfortunes, these \
criminal\\nspoliators are playing with the health and life of millions \
of\\nsoldiers and workers, for their own benefit.\\n\\nSuch a situation \
cannot be borne a single day longer.\\n\\nThe Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars proposes to the Military\\nRevolutionary \
Committee to take the most decisive measures towards\\nthe uprooting of \
speculation, sabotage, hiding of supplies,\\nfraudulent detention of cargoes, \
etc.\\n\\nAll persons guilty of such actions shall be subject, by \
special\\norders of the Military Revolutionary Committee, to immediate arrest\
\\nand confinement in the prisons of Cronstadt, pending their\\narraignment \
before the Revolutionary Tribunal.\\n\\nAll the popular organisations are \
invited to cooperate in the\\nstruggle against the spoliators of food \

KALEDIN\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The situation at Petrograd is desperate. \
The city is cut off from\\nthe outside world and is entirely in the power of \
the Bolsheviki....\\nPeople are arrested in the streets, thrown into the \
Neva, drowned and\\nimprisoned without any charge. Even Burtzev is shut up in \
Peter-Paul\\nfortress, under strict guard.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
organisation at whose head I am is working without rest to unite\\nall the \
officers and what is left of the _yunker_ schools, and to arm\\nthem. The \
situation cannot be saved except by creating regiments of\\nofficers and \
_yunkers._ Attacking with these regiments, and having\\ngained a first \
success, we could later gain the aid of the garrison\\ntroops; but without \
that first success it is impossible to count on a\\nsingle soldier, because \
thousands of them are divided and terrorised\\nby the scum which exists in \
every regiment. Most of the Cossacks are\\ntainted by Bolshevik propaganda, \
thanks to the strange policy of\\nGeneral Dutov, who allowed to pass the \
moment when by decisive action\\nsomething could have been obtained. The \
policy of negotiations and\\nconcessions has borne its fruits; all that is \
respectable is\\npersecuted, and it is the _plebe_ and the criminals who \
dominate--and\\nnothing can be done except by shooting and hanging \
them.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We are awaiting you here, General, and at \
the moment of your\\narrival, we shall advance with all the forces at our \
disposal. But\\nfor that we must establish some communication with you, and \
before\\nall, clear up the following points:\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote](1) \
Do you know that in your name all officers who could take part\\nin the fight \
are being invited to leave Petrograd on the pretext of\\njoining you?\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote](2) About when can we count on your arrival at \
Petrograd? We should\\nlike to know in order to coordinate our actions.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In spite of the criminal inaction of the conscious \
people here,\\nwhich allowed the yoke of Bolshevism to be laid upon us--in \
spite of\\nthe extraordinary pig--headedness of the majority of officers, \
so\\ndifficult to organise--we believe in spite of all that Truth is on\\nour \
side, and that we shall conquer the vicious and criminal forces\\nwho say \
that they are acting for motives of love of country and in\\norder to save \
it. Whatever comes, we shall not permit ourselves to be\\nstruck down, and \
shall remain firm until the end.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\nPurishkevitch, \

Russia:_\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades workers, soldiers, \
peasants--all toilers!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution has won at \
Petrograd, at\\nMoscow.... From the Front and the villages arrive every day, \
every\\nhour, greetings to the new Government.... The victory of \
the\\nRevolution.... is assured, seeing that it is sustained by the \
majority\\nof the people.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]It is entirely \
understandable that the proprietors and the\\ncapitalists, the employees and \
functionaries closely allied with the\\nbourgeoisic--in a word, all the rich \
and all those who join hands with\\nthem--regard the new Revolution with \
hostility, oppose its success,\\nthreaten to halt the activity of the banks, \
and sabotage or obstruct\\nthe work of other establishments.... Every \
conscious worker understands\\nperfectly that we cannot avoid this hostility, \
because the high\\nofficials have set themselves against the People and do \
not wish to\\nabandon their posts without resistance. But the working classes \
are\\nnot for one moment afraid of that resistance. The majority of \
the\\npeople are for us. For us are the majority of the workers and \
the\\noppressed of the whole world. We have justice on our side. \
Our\\nultimate victory is certain.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The resistance \
of the capitalists and high officials will be broken.\\nNo one will be \
deprived of his property without a special law on the\\nnationalisation of \
banks and financial syndicates. This law is in\\npreparation. Not a worker \
will lose a single kopek; on the contrary,\\nhe will be assisted. Without at \
this moment establishing the new\\ntaxes, the new Government considers one of \
its primary duties to make\\na severe accounting and control on the reception \
of taxes decreed by\\nthe former r\[EAcute]gime....\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades workers! Remember that you yourselves direct \
the\\nGovernment. No one will help you unless you organise yourselves \
and\\ntake into your own hands the affairs of the State. Your Soviets \
are\\nnow the organs of governmental power.... Strengthen them, establish \
a\\nsevere revolutionary control, pitilessly crush the attempts at\\nanarchy \
on the part of drunkards, brigands, counter-revolutionary\\n_yunkers_ and \
Kornilovists.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Establish a strict control over \
production and the accounting for\\nproducts. Arrest and turn over to the \
Revolutionary Tribunal of the\\nPeople every one who injures the property of \
the People, by sabotage\\nin production, by concealment of grain-reserves, \
reserves of other\\nproducts, by retarding the shipments of grain, by \
bringing confusion\\ninto the railroads, the posts and the telegraphs, or in \
general\\nopposing the great work of bringing Peace and transferring the Land\
\\nto the peasants....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades workers, \
soldiers, peasants--all toilers!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Take immediately \
all local power into your hands.... Little by little,\\nwith the consent of \
the majority of peasants, we shall march firmly\\nand unhesitatingly toward \
the victory of Socialism, which will\\nfortify the advance-guards of the \
working-class of the most civilised\\nCountries, and give to the peoples an \
enduring peace, and free them\\nfrom every slavery and every exploitation.\

of Petrograd!_\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades! The Revolution is \
winning--the revolution has won. All the\\npower has passed over to our \
Soviets. The first weeks are the most\\ndifficult ones. The broken reaction \
must be finally crushed, a full\\ntriumph must be secured to our endeavours. \
The working-class ought\\nto--must--show in these days THE GREATEST FIRMNESS \
AND ENDURANCE, in\\norder to facilitate the execution of all the aims of the \
new People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nGovernment of Soviets. In the next few days \
decrees on the Labour\\nquestion will be issued, and among the very first \
will be the decree\\non Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Control over the production \
and regulation of Industry.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]STRIKES AND \
DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE WORKER MASSES IN PETROGRAD NOW CAN\\nONLY DO \
HARM.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]We ask you to cease immediately all \
economic and political strikes,\\nto take up your work, and do it in perfect \
order. The work in the\\nfactories and all the industries is necessary for \
the new Government\\nof Soviets, because any interruption of this work will \
only create\\nnew difficulties for us, and we have enough as it is. All to \
your\\nplaces.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The best way to support the new \

COSSACKS\\n\\n_\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Brothers-Cossacks._\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]You are being deceived. You are being incited against \
the People.\\nYou are told that the Soviets of Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies are your \
enemies, that they want to take away your Cossack\\nland, your Cossack \
\[OpenCurlyQuote]liberty\[CloseCurlyQuote]. Don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t believe \
it, Cossacks.... Your own\\nGenerals and landowners are deceiving you, in \
order to keep you in\\ndarkness and slavery. We, the Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars,\\naddress ourselves to you, Cossacks, with \
these words. Read them\\nattentively and judge yourselves which is the truth \
and which is\\ncruel deceit. The life and service of a Cossack were always \
bondage\\nand penal servitude. At the first call of the authorities a Cossack\
\\nalways had to saddle his horse and ride out on campaign. All \
his\\nmilitary equipment a Cossack had to provide with his own \
hardly\\nearned means. A Cossack is on service, his farm is going to rack and\
\\nruin. Is such a condition fair? No, it must be altered for ever. \
THE\\nCOSSACKS MUST BE FREED FROM BONDAGE. The new People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Soviet power is\\nwilling to come to the assistance of the toiling Cossacks. \
It is only\\nnecessary that the Cossacks themselves should resolve to abolish \
the\\nold order, that they should refuse submission to their \
slave-driver\\nofficers, land-owners, rich men, that they should throw off \
the\\ncursed yoke from their necks. Arise, Cossacks! Unite! The Council \
of\\nPeople\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars calls upon you to enter a new, \
fresh, more happy\\nlife.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]In November and \
December in Petrograd there were All-Russian\\nCongresses of Soviets of \
Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\nThese Congresses transferred all the authority \
in the different\\nlocalities into the hands of the Soviets, i.e., into the \
hands of men\\nelected by the People. From now on there must be in Russia no \
rulers\\nor functionaries who command the People from above and drive \
them.\\nThe People create the authority themselves. A General has no \
more\\nrights than a soldier. All are equal. Consider, Cossacks, is \
this\\nwrong or right? We are calling upon you, Cossacks, to join this \
new\\norder and to create your own Soviets of Cossacks\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies. To such\\nSoviets all the power must belong in the different \
localities. Not to\\n_hetmans_ with the rank of General, but to the \
elected\\nrepresentatives of the toiling Cossacks, to your own \
trustworthy\\nreliable men.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The All-Russian \
Congresses of Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], and \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies have passed a resolution to transfer \
all landowners\[CloseCurlyQuote] land\\ninto the possession of the toiling \
people. Is not that fair,\\nCossacks? The Kornilovs, Kaledins, Dutovs, \
Karaulovs, Bardizhes, all\\ndefend with their whole souls the interests of \
the rich men, and they\\nare ready to drown Russia in blood if only the lands \
remain in the\\nhands of the landowners. But you, the toiling Cossacks, do \
not you\\nsuffer yourselves from poverty, oppression and lack of land? How \
many\\nCossacks are there who have more than 4-5 _dessiatins_ per head? \
But\\nthe landowners, who have thousands of _dessiatins_ of their own \
land,\\nwish besides to get into their hands the lands of the Cossack \
Army.\\nAccording to the new Soviet laws, the lands of Cossack \
landowners\\nmust pass without compensation into the hands of the Cossack \
workers,\\nthe poorer Cossacks. You are being told that the Soviets wish to \
take\\naway your lands from you. Who is frightening you? The rich \
Cossacks,\\nwho know that the Soviet AUTHORITY WISHES TO transfer the \
landowners\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nlands to you. Choose then, Cossacks, for whom \
will you stand: for the\\nKornilovs and Kaledins, for the Generals and rich \
men, or for the\\nSoviets of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Cossacks\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Deputies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]THE COUNCIL OF \
PEOPLE\[CloseCurlyQuote]s COMMISSARS elected by the All-Russian\\nCongress \
HAS PROPOSED TO ALL NATIONS AN IMMEDIATE ARMISTICE AND AN\\nHONOURABLE \
DEMOCRATIC PEACE WITHOUT LOSS OR DETRIMENT TO ANY NATION.\\nAll the \
capitalists, landowners, Generals-Kornilovists have risen\\nagainst the \
peaceful policy of the Soviets. The war was bringing\\nthem profits, power, \
distinctions. And to you, Cossack privates?\\nYou were perishing without \
reason, without purpose, like your\\nbrothers-soldiers and sailors. It will \
soon be three years and a half\\nthat this accursed war has gone on, a war \
devised by the capitalists\\nand landowners of all countries for their own \
profit, their world\\nrobberies. To the toiling Cossacks the war has only \
brought ruin and\\ndeath. The war has drained all the resources from Cossack \
farm life.\\nThe only salvation for the whole of our country and for the \
Cossacks\\nin particular is a prompt and honest peace. The Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s\\nCommissars has declared to all Governments and peoples: \
We do not\\nwant other people\[CloseCurlyQuote]s property, and we do not wish \
to give away our\\nown. Peace without annexations and without indemnities. \
Every nation\\nmust decide its own fate. There must be no oppressing of one \
nation\\nby another. Such is the honest, democratic, \
People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s peace which the\\nCouncil of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars is proposing to all Governments, to\\nall \
peoples, allies and enemies. And the results are visible: ON THE\\nRUSSIAN \
FRONT AN ARMISTICE HAS BEEN CONCLUDED.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]The \
soldier\[CloseCurlyQuote]s and the Cossack\[CloseCurlyQuote]s blood is not \
flowing there any more.\\nNow, Cossacks, decide: do you wish to continue this \
ruinous,\\nsenseless, criminal slaughter? Then support the Cadets, the \
enemies\\nof the people, support Tchernov, Tseretelli, Skobeliev, who drove \
you\\ninto the offensive of July 1st; support Kornilov, who \
introduced\\ncapital punishment for soldiers and Cossacks at the front. BUT \
IF YOU\\nWISH A PROMPT AND HONEST PEACE, THEN ENTER THE RANKS OF THE \
SOVIETS\\nAND SUPPORT THE COUNCIL OF PEOPLE\[CloseCurlyQuote]s COMMISSARS.\\n\
\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Your fate, Cossacks, lies in your own hands. Our \
common foes, the\\nlandowners, capitalists, officers-Kornilovists, bourgeois \
newspapers,\\nare deceiving you and driving you along the road to ruin. \
In\\nOrenburg, Dutov has arrested the Soviet and disarmed the \
garrison.\\nKaledin is threatening the Soviets in the province of the Don. He \
has\\ndeclared the province to be in a state of war and is assembling \
his\\ntroops. Karaulov is shooting the local tribes in the Caucasus. \
The\\nCadet bourgeoisie is supplying them with its millions. Their \
common\\naim is to suppress the People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Soviets, to crush \
the workers and\\npeasants, to introduce again the discipline of the whip in \
the army,\\nand to eternalise the bondage of the toiling Cossacks.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Our revolutionary troops are moving to the Don and the \
Ural in order\\nto put an end to this criminal revolt against the people. The\
\\ncommanders of the revolutionary troops have received orders not to\\nenter \
into any negotiations with the mutinous Generals, to act\\ndecisively and \
mercilessly.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Cossacks! On you depends now whether \
your brothers\[CloseCurlyQuote] blood is to flow\\nstill. We are holding out \
our hand to you. Join the whole people\\nagainst its enemies. Declare \
Kaledin, Kornilov, Dutov, Karaulov and\\nall their aiders and abettors to be \
the enemies of the people,\\ntraitors and betrayers. Arrest them with your \
own forces and turn\\nthem over into the hands of the Soviet authority, which \
will judge\\nthem in open and public Revolutionary Tribunal. Cossacks! \
Form\\nSoviets of Cossacks\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies. Take into your \
toil-worn hands the\\nmanagement of all the affairs of the Cossacks. Take \
away the lands of\\nyour own wealthy landowners. Take over their grain, their \
inventoried\\nproperty and live-stock for the cultivation of the lands of the\
\\ntoiling Cossacks, who are ruined by the \
war.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Forward, Cossacks, to the fight for the \
common cause of the people!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live the toiling \
Cossacks!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live the union of the Cossacks, \
the soldiers, peasants and\\nworkers!\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live \
the power of the Soviets of Cossacks\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote], Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Down with \
the war! Down with the landowners and the\\nKornilovist-Generals!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Long live Peace and the Brotherhood of peoples!\
\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n                                _Council of \

\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades Workingmen and Workingwomen!\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]A few days before the holidays, a strike has been \
declared by the\\nteachers of the public schools. The teachers side with \
the\\nbourgeoisie against the Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades, organise \
parents\[CloseCurlyQuote] committees and pass resolutions against\\nthe \
strike of the teachers. Propose to the Ward Soviets of Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nand Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, the Trade \
Unions, the Factory-Shop and Party\\nCommittees, to organise protest \
meetings. Arrange with your own\\nresources Christmas trees and \

after the holidays, at the date\\nwhich will be set by the Duma.\\n\\n\
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades, strengthen your position in matters of \

over the\\nschools.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n_Commission on Public \

CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT\\n\\nThe notes issued by Trotzky to \
the Allies and to the neutral powers,\\nas well as the note of the Allied \
military Attach\[EAcute]s to General\\nDukhonin, are too voluminous to give \
here. Moreover they belong to\\nanother phase of the history of the Soviet \
Republic, with which this\\nbook has nothing to do--the foreign relations of \
the Soviet\\nGovernment. This I treat at length in the next volume, \
\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Kornilov \
to\\nBrest-Litovsk.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n19.\\n\\nAPPEALS TO THE \
FRONT AGAINST DUKHONIN\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... The struggle for peace \
has met with the resistance of the\\nbourgeoisie and the \
counter-revolutionary Generals.... From the\\naccounts in the newspapers, at \
the _Stavka_ of former Supreme\\nCommander Dukhonin are gathering the agents \
and allies of the\\nbourgeoisie, Verkhovski, Avksentiev, Tchernov, Gotz, \
Tseretelli, etc.\\nIt seems even that they want to form a new power against \
the Soviets.\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Comrades soldiers! All the persons \
we have mentioned have been\\nMinisters already. They have acted in accord \
with Kerensky and the\\nbourgeoisie. They are responsible for the offensive \
of July 1st and\\nfor the prolongation of the war. They promised the land to \
the\\npeasants and then arrested the Land Committees. They \
reestablished\\ncapital punishment for soldiers. They obey the orders of \
French,\\nEnglish and American \
financiers....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]General Dukhonin, for having \
refused to obey orders of the Council\\nof People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
Commissars, has been dismissed from his position as\\nSupreme Commander.... \
For answer he is circulating among the troops the\\nnote from the Military \
Attach\[EAcute]s of the Allied imperialist Powers, and\\nattempting to \
provoke a counter-revolution....\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Do not obey \
Dukhonin! Pay no attention to his provocation! Watch him\\nand his group of \
counter-revolutionary Generals carefully....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n20.\
\\n\\nFROM KRYLENKO\\n\\n_Order Number Two_\\n\\n\[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]... \
The ex-Supreme Commander, General Dukhonin, for having opposed\\nresistance \
to the execution of orders, for criminal action\\nsusceptible of provoking a \
new civil war, is declared enemy of the\\nPeople. All persons who support \
Dukhonin will be arrested, without\\nrespect to their social or political \
position or their past. Persons\\nequipped with special authority will \
operate these arrests. I charge\\nGeneral Manikhovsky with the execution of \
the above-mentioned\\ndispositions....\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote]\\n\\n\\\
nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER XII\\n\\n1.\\n\\nINSTRUCTION TO PEASANTS\\n\\nIn answer \
to the numerous enquiries coming from peasants, it is\\nhereby explained that \
the whole power in the country is from now on\\nheld by the Soviets of the \
Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote], Soldiers\[CloseCurlyQuote], and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]\\nDeputies. The Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] Revolution, \
after having conquered in\\nPetrograd and in Moscow, is now conquering in all \
other centres of\\nRussia. The Workers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government safeguards the\\ninterests of the masses of \
peasantry, the poorest of them; it is with\\nthe majority of peasants and \
workers against the landowners, and\\nagainst the capitalists.\\n\\nHence the \
Soviets of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, and before all the \
District\\nSoviets, and subsequently those of the Provinces, are from now on \
and\\nuntil the Constituent Assembly meets, full-powered bodies of \
State\\nauthority in their localities. All landlords\[CloseCurlyQuote] titles \
to the land are\\ncancelled by the second All-Russian Congress of Soviets. A \
decree\\nregarding the land has already been issued by the present \
Provisional\\nWorkers\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] \
Government. On the basis of the above decree\\nall lands hitherto belonging \
to landlords now pass entirely and\\nwholly into the hands of the Soviets of \
Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies. The\\n_Volost_ (a group of several \
villages forms a _Volost_) Land\\nCommittees are immediately to take over all \
land from the landlords,\\nand to keep a strict account over it, watching \
that order be\\nmaintained, and that the whole estate be well guarded, seeing \
that\\nfrom now on all private estates become public property and \
must\\ntherefore be protected by the people themselves.\\n\\nAll orders given \
by the _Volost_ Land Committees, adopted with the\\nassent of the District \
Soviets of Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Deputies, in fulfilment\\nof the \
decrees issued by the revolutionary power, are absolutely\\nlegal and are to \
be forthwith and irrefutably brought into execution.\\n\\nThe Workers\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] and Peasants\[CloseCurlyQuote] Government appointed by the \
second\\nAll-Russian Congress of Soviets has received the name of the Council\
\\nof People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars.\\n\\nThe Council of People\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars summons the Peasants to take the\\nwhole power \
into their hands in every locality.\\n\\nThe workers will in every way \
absolutely and entirely support the\\npeasants, arrange for them all that is \
required in connection with\\nmachines and tools, and in return they request \
the peasants to help\\nwith the transport of grain.\\n\\n                  \
_President of the Council of People\[CloseCurlyQuote]s Commissars,_\\n        \
                               V. ULIANOV (LENIN).\\n\\nPetrograd, November \
18th, 1917.\\n\\n2.\\n\\nThe full-powered Congress of Peasants\
\[CloseCurlyQuote] Soviets met about a week\\nlater, and continued for \
several weeks. Its history is merely an\\nexpanded version of the history of \
the \[OpenCurlyDoubleQuote]Extraordinary Conference.\[CloseCurlyDoubleQuote] \
At\\nfirst the great majority of the delegates were hostile to the \
Soviet\\nGovernment, and supported the reactionary wing. Several days \
later\\nthe assembly was supporting the moderates with Tchernov. And \
several\\ndays after that the vast majority of the Congress were voting for \
the\\nfaction of Maria Spiridonova, and sending their representatives \
into\\nthe _Tsay-ee-kah_ at Smolny.... The Right Wing then walked out of \
the\\nCongress and called a Congress of its own, which went on, \
dwindling\\nfrom day to day, until it finally dissolved....\"\>",
